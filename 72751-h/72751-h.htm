<small>CAP’N CRUMBIE IS SURPRISED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“A lucky thing so few of the boats were
out when the storm came up!” said Jack
Holden. “I guess they’d have had a pretty
hard time of it yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Cap’n” Crumbie nodded in satisfaction.
“Only one missing,” he replied. “And why?
<em>Why?</em> ’Cause Cap’n Crumbie told ’em what
to expect. Not far out, I ain’t, as a rule.
There was nigh a dozen o’ ’em wanting to get
away to the grounds when I told ’em the gale
was coming. And most o’ ’em took my advice
and stayed safe an’ snug at home. ’Tain’t
that I’m wanting to blow my own trumpet, as
the saying is, but facts is facts. Bob Sennet
laughed at me and put to sea. <em>Laughed</em> at me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
mind you! Obstinate as they make ’em, Bob
is—or should say <em>was</em>—just like his father afore
him. If he hadn’t been so obstinate he’d ha’
been here to-day, alive an’ well. An’ instead o’
that, see where he is!”</p>

<p>“Where, Cap’n?” asked the boy, gravely.</p>

<p>The Cap’n dropped his voice to a sepulchral
rumble. “Fathoms deep, son! Fathoms deep
somewheres out there, he and the <i>Ellen E.
Hanks</i> together; aye, and all hands as well.
Fathoms deep; mark my words!”</p>

<p>Jack, suppressing a disrespectful grin,
glanced seaward in the direction of the Cap’n’s
pointing hand. The scene there held no suggestion
of tragedy. The storm of the last two
days was over. Since early morning the leaden
skies had turned to blue and the fresh, salty
breeze that swept in from the broad Atlantic
was but the tag-end of the terrific gale that had
lashed the waters of the harbor and raced,
shrieking, up the quaint, narrow streets of the
town. Now, instead of the storm-wrack, a few
white clouds sailed eastward, and, in place of
the fury of tormented waters, the harbor and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the sea beyond the breakwater reflected the blue
of the heavens in their dancing, white-capped
waves.</p>

<p>A mile away, Gull Island was fringed with
creamy foam, and, farther still, at the tip-end
of the Point, the squat stone lighthouse gleamed
snowy-white against the clear horizon. Washed
and swept by rain and wind, the little Massachusetts
fishing-town of Greenport looked
bright and clean this May afternoon. The
fishing-schooners, some at anchor, some lying
snug at the wharves, were drying their sails in
the warm sunlight.</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie viewed them approvingly as,
with Jack at his side, he paced to and fro on
Garnett and Sayer’s wharf, his short, slightly
bowed legs working with the regularity of a
pendulum, six paces nor’east, then six paces
so’west. He had traveled a good many miles
in that fashion in the last twenty years, for he
was watchman at Garnett and Sayer’s, and this
stretch of clear space on the busy wharf was
the Cap’n’s quarter-deck. He was, let it be
confessed, no ancient deep-sea mariner, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
he had all the marks of the ocean-going
skipper—leathery, crinkled face, with crow’s-feet
at the corners of his twinkling eyes, skin
tanned deeply from long exposure to the salt
sea air, a fringe of yellowish-white whiskers,
and a deep growl of a voice. True it is that he
had been a captain, but captain only of a center-board
sail-boat in which, before he had given
up the precarious life, he had taken out pleasure
parties for a day’s fishing—including chowder—or
for a run around the Head. But
everybody didn’t know that, more especially
the “summer folks,” and among the latter he
held the reputation for being not only the most
dependable weather-prophet along the coast
but a perfect example of the old-time ship’s
captain, with experience gathered from Iceland
to Fiji, from Seattle to Siam. And many a
good yarn Cap’n Crumbie could spin, too, of
his adventures in far-off climes. Indeed, he
had related some of them so frequently that he
had long since grown to believe them!</p>

<p>Jack had spent all of his sixteen years in
Greenport and so knew the Cap’n for what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
was, a kind-hearted, eccentric, and amusing old
character.</p>

<p>“But,” he said, suppressing a smile, “if Bob
does come back he’s pretty sure to have a tremendous
catch. The mackerel are in and the
water’s boiling with them, they say.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, maybe,” blustered the Cap’n; “but
what good’s a load o’ mackerel to a drowned
man? Terrible bad weather it was yesterday.
Don’t know when I’ve seen such a snorter.
Guess the last one was three years ago, the time
your father was robbed.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” replied Jack. “There was a
fierce gale that night, wasn’t there? Poor
Dad was wet through when they brought him
home. He’s never talked much about the robbery,
Cap’n, and I never really understood just
what happened that night. But I do know
that poor Dad’s never been quite the same
since.”</p>

<p>“And no wonder,” answered the Cap’n.
“He was hard hit, Jack. More’n a thousand
dollars went, as near as I recall.”</p>

<p>“Twelve hundred and forty. I asked him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
once and he told me, but he said I wasn’t to talk
about it again.”</p>

<p>“Well, by gravy, ’twas a shame, anyway!”
said the Cap’n, emphatically, with a belligerent
glance at Barker’s wharf across the
slip.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it queer that they never caught any
one!” Jack observed.</p>

<p>“That’s what Simon Barker always said,”
replied the Cap’n, dryly, “but when he says
that, he’s trying to suggest that Samuel Holden
knows more about the affair than he cares to
tell.”</p>

<p>Jack flushed slightly, and threw his shoulders
back.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten that,” he said quietly. “I
remember, though, that it was you who found
Dad. You didn’t see anybody about, of
course?”</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie shook his head.</p>

<p>“And I don’t know as they mightn’t have
suspected me, if it hadn’t so happened that the
new Baptist parson was with me, and they had
to take his word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what’s your theory of it, Cap’n?”
Jack asked.</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie paused in his sentry-go to
stuff shreds of tobacco into the much blackened
bowl of his old brier pipe and then, with deftness
born of practice extending over many
years on the exposed wharf, struck a match,
cupped it in both hands under the lee of a broad
shoulder turned away from the breeze, and
puffed contentedly for a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, if I don’t know what happened that
night, there ain’t no one as does,” he said at
length, with a slightly judicial air. He had told
the story a good many times, not because there
was anything specially stirring about it, but
because he was directly concerned and because
it happened to be the nearest approach to an adventure
ever happening to him in all his three
score years—if one excepted the time when he
fell overboard from his sail-boat and, after a
few thrilling seconds, was ignominiously pulled
back to safety by one of his passengers, who
passed a boat-hook through his trousers.
“Your father and Simon Barker were partners,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
as you know, as fish-merchants. ’Twas a pity
Samuel Holden ever joined up with a feller like
Barker, because nobody ever did any good harnessed
to a mean cuss like that. They started
in a small way, with one schooner, the <i>Grace
and Ella</i>. There she is, now, lying up against
Barker’s wharf. And many a thousand-dollars’
worth of fish has been landed from over
her side since then. At the time I’m speaking
of, she’d come in with a big haul, that fetched
high prices. A day or two after that the gale
sprang up. And it <em>was</em> a storm. Never since
I was in the Indian Ocean—umph—er—er—”</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie coughed discreetly, remembering
that his audience was “home folks,” and
then resumed quite without embarrassment:</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying, it was a gale that
fair knocked Greenport galley-endwise. It
started all of a sudden, raining cats and dogs,
and the wind was so strong you couldn’t stand
up. We lost two of our best fishing-vessels that
day; windows were blown in and roofs ripped
off; and a bunch o’ little sail-boats lying at their
moorings were blown clean out to sea. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
’em never were found again. One or two got
smashed up on the rocks. One of ’em went
’way up ’round Indian Head, drifted up the tide
way o’ the Sangus River, and lodged on the
sand-dunes there. Then the sea piled the sand
up, changed the course o’ the river, and she’s
been left high and dry ever since.”</p>

<p>“You mean the old <i>Sea-Lark</i>?” put in Jack.</p>

<p>The watchman nodded.</p>

<p>“I know where she is,” observed the boy.
“I’ve climbed aboard her several times.
She’s lying a couple of hundred yards from the
river now.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Cap’n Crumbie went on, “that night,
just when the gale was starting, your father left
the office with the money he’d drawn from the
bank to pay off the crew of the <i>Grace and Ella</i>.
It was in a canvas bag, notes and silver together,
and he didn’t like leaving it at the office
all night. I was coming down High Street, when
I met the parson, and we walked along together
a ways. It was hard going and all-fired dark,
when we turned down Wharf Street and fell
right over your father. He was lying all in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
heap on the sidewalk. I didn’t know it was
him at first, mind you, because it was so dark.
Parson and me tried to get him onto his feet,
but he was all limp, like a wet string, and so we
carried him into Simmons’s house, and there
we saw who it was. When he recovered a bit
he told us he’d been robbed. He had no idea
who’d done it. All he knew was that he was
hurrying along, with his head bent down, when
some one laid hold of him. Then he got a
smashing blow on the head, and didn’t know
anything more until he came to in Simmons’s
kitchen.”</p>

<p>“And the police never found any clue?”
Jack asked.</p>

<p>“Not as I ever heard of. But Simon Barker
went nearly crazy. You’d have thought, by the
way he fussed, that Sam Holden was the biggest
criminal unhung. Barker lost his head.
He’s that mean he hates to see a mosquito walking
on his wall-paper ’cause it’s wearing out
the paper. You’d have thought it was him
that had been half killed instead of Sam Holden.
He swore ’twas a put-up job, and that your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
father had done it himself somehow, to get away
with the money. And mighty unpopular he
made himself by saying such things. Some of
us told him what we thought o’ him, next day,
and then he began to calm down a bit, but by
that time the thief had covered up his tracks,
and nobody has ever heard any explanation o’
what happened, from that day to this. It cost
your father his partnership in the business,
’cause he had too much pride to go on working
with a man who had as good as called him a
thief, and he sold his home to replace the money
that was stolen. I did hear that Simon Barker
came near dropping dead when your dad handed
it to him. You see, if things had been t’other
way round, Barker couldn’t have brought himself
to do such a thing in a month o’ Sundays,
and so he couldn’t understand any one else
doing it. Your father wasn’t obliged to pay
the money to Barker, o’ course. If a thing gets
stole, it’s stole, and that’s all there is to it.
But your father wanted to clear his name. And
he did, don’t you ever doubt it, Jack! Maybe
Barker still has a sneaking notion that it was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
put-up job, but if he does I can’t see how he
figures your father made anything by it!”</p>

<p>“How <em>can</em> he?” protested Jack.</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie shook his head, and cast a
glance in the direction of the tug <i>Simon P.
Barker</i>, which was being coaled noisily at its
owner’s wharf thirty yards away.</p>

<p>“I ain’t no Shylock Holmes, son,” he said.
“Maybe he thinks what he says, and maybe he
says what he don’t think. I shouldn’t faint
right now if some one told me here and now that
Barker knew more than your father did about
the robbery.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean—”</p>

<p>“No, Jack, no. I ain’t saying Barker had
anything to do with it, because, to give him his
due, he wasn’t never convicted o’ theft. I
b’lieve he’s honest, and if he is, it’s only because
he’s too mean to give his time to the
Government, in prison.”</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by the approach
of a stranger, who, after looking across
the harbor, addressed the watchman.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he said, “but will you tell me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
where I can find the ferry to East Greenport?”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no ferry, and there ain’t never
been one,” replied the watchman, “though
’tain’t for the want o’ customers. Sometimes
in the summer I’ve been asked that same question
a dozen times a day.”</p>

<p>“How can I get over there?” the stranger
asked, looking dubiously at the intervening mile
of water. “There is no trolley and it is rather
a long way to walk with this grip.”</p>

<p>“A little ways round that corner,” replied
the watchman, pointing off the wharf, “you’ll
find Hinkley’s stable, and you’ll get a carriage
there.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie watched the man speculatively
until he had disappeared, but Jack was
looking out at the stretch of water between the
wharf and the distant hotel, with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“I say, Cap’n,” he said a few moments later,
“did you mean it when you said lots of people
want to be ferried across to the Point during
the summer?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, son,” replied the watchman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
“You never heard me say anything that wasn’t
the truth, did you?”</p>

<p>Jack smiled and almost made some reference
to the Indian Ocean; but other thoughts were
buzzing at the back of his brain.</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t anybody ever started a ferry,
then, if there’s need of one?” he asked.</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie put his head on one side and
looked down at the ocean.</p>

<p>“Ever swallow sea-water, Jack?” he asked.</p>

<p>“When I was swimming, many a time.”</p>

<p>“What does it taste of?”</p>

<p>“Salt, of course.”</p>

<p>“Salt is right. But there’s all manner o’
things in it besides salt—even gold, I’ve heard
say. It’s there, for the taking, and no danger
o’ the ocean running dry. Well, did you ever
hear o’ any one in Greenport starting to take
salt or gold out o’ the sea. No. O’ <em>course</em> you
didn’t. Don’t ask me why. I don’t know.
But I reckon it’s about the same reason why nobody
ever started to run a ferry across to the
Point from here. Either they didn’t think of
it, or it’s too much trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>“When the summer cottagers come back and
the hotel opens, I guess there would be plenty
of business,” Jack mused. “You’d think the
hotel alone would make it pay.”</p>

<p>“Probably ’twould,” the Cap’n agreed.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” said Jack, thoughtfully;
and then, as his eyes fell on something away
out to sea, beyond the breakwater, he suppressed
an exclamation and glanced amusedly
at Cap’n Crumbie, who was engaged in a contest
with his obstinate pipe.</p>

<p>“Too bad about Bob Sennet!” the boy said.
“You think the <i>Ellen E. Hanks</i> must have
foundered with all hands, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Aye, with all hands,” declared Cap’n Crumbie,
wagging his head. “Fathoms deep, they
must be now, floating around among the fish
they went after. I’m not denying they’d ha’
made a big haul o’ mackerel, and they’d ha’ had
the market all to themselves. But there, obstinate
folks have to pay for their obstinacy
sooner or later! I warned Bob, but ’twas no
use.”</p>

<p>“There’s a boat coming in now,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
boy, pointing to the craft, which, with all sail
set, was rounding the end of the breakwater,
her hatches evidently full, for her hull was low.
“If she isn’t the <i>Ellen E. Hanks</i> she’s awfully
like her.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie shot a glance over the harbor,
and a look of mingled surprise and chagrin
crossed his rugged face.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he said finally. “Some folks are
like Jeff Trefry’s old tom-cat for luck. Jeff
tied the cat up in a sack and dropped him off
the wharf and afore he’d more than turned
around that cat comes marchin’ into the kitchen
with a flounder in his mouth!”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">A few minutes later Jack left the watchman,
and made his way through town
toward the cottage in which he lived. And as
he went, his mind busied itself with the idea of
the ferry suggested by Cap’n Crumbie.</p>

<p>Jack Holden was as care-free as any boy of
his age in Greenport. For him, life so far had
contained little but healthy sport and amusement,
and the question of earning money had
never concerned him. Nor was it the wish of
his father that it should. Yet, despite his natural
light-heartedness, Jack had a level head.
The time would come, and before very long,
when he must face the problem of winning a
place for himself in the world. It had been
decided that, if it could be arranged, he was to
spend another two years at High School, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
which he would seek a position. But two years
is a long time, and Jack was by no means certain
that he would not have to turn out and
become a wage-earner long before his education
was completed. For his father was now a
very different man from the old Samuel Holden.
Since the robbery, troubles had piled themselves
on his shoulders somewhat seriously. First
had come the loss of Jack’s mother, from which
Mr. Holden had never really recovered. Then
had followed that blow on the head inflicted by
the thief, which had necessitated numerous visits
to a costly eye specialist, in order to preserve
his sight. Finally, with his business
taken away from under his feet, he had been in
financial straits ever since. After selling his
home to make good the missing money, he had
taken a small cottage on the outskirts of Greenport
and gone to work as a bookkeeper for Garnett
and Sayer, the fish-packers. Had his wife
lived, with her indomitable spirit and unending
courage—characteristics which, fortunately, she
had bestowed upon her son—she would have
buoyed him up and kept alive his old ambition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
But now his worries told on him, and
it was that fact which caused Jack to wonder
sometimes whether his own education would
ever be completed as he would like it to be.</p>

<p>If, he reflected, as he walked home, he could
only start that ferry and so bring a little grist
to the mill, it would at least help to relieve his
father of some of his anxiety. But one cannot
make bricks without straw. And he was
face to face with the cold fact that he had no
boat, nor any chance of acquiring one. At
home, he looked over his sum total of worldly
possessions. There was four dollars and
twenty cents in the savings-bank. He had a
nickel and two dimes in his pocket. Also, he
owned a silver watch, of little value, as most
of its works were missing. There was a penknife,
which he had bought after much careful
deliberation, and there was—well, little else
save rubbish, worth nothing when it came to a
question of raising enough money to buy a
boat suitable for Holden’s Ferry.</p>

<p>“Holden’s Ferry!” Jack repeated aloud,
smiling a little at the sound. The name had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
an agreeable ring to it. It would be fun. And
at the same time it might be fairly profitable
fun.</p>

<p>In the evening, when his father returned,
Jack immediately introduced the subject uppermost
in his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Dad,” he began impulsively, “how can I
get a boat, twenty feet long, or something like
that—one that will hold ten or a dozen people
and won’t leak more than about ten buckets of
water an hour.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that?” asked Mr. Holden, in
surprise.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea, and I want a boat, Dad,”
replied Jack. “I thought—perhaps—somehow—”</p>

<p>“I wish I could buy you one, my lad,” said
Mr. Holden, a trifle dejectedly, “but you’ll
have to wait till my ship comes in.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it for pleasure—not altogether,
that is,” the boy declared.</p>

<p>“Not for pleasure? Then what on earth—
Are you thinking of setting up in the shipping
business?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Jack chuckled.</p>

<p>“I may do a little freight-carrying,” he said
with mock seriousness, “but the passenger
trade is what I was thinking of chiefly.”</p>

<p>“Modest youth! You’ll want to go into
steam for that, though,” said Mr. Holden, jokingly.
“It is a pretty tall proposition for a
youngster of your age. Have you fixed on just
what ports you are going to trade at?”</p>

<p>“Only Greenport, Dad. But I’m in earnest.”</p>

<p>Still slightly amused, Mr. Holden stroked his
chin and eyed his son inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Well, what is this wonderful scheme of
yours?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I want to run a ferry between Garnett and
Sayer’s wharf and the hotel landing on the
Point,” the boy replied. “There is no way of
getting across except by hiring a boat or walking
around, or taking a carriage; and plenty
of people would pay a dime to be run across
there in a ferry-boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Dad. I’ve had this in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
mind all the afternoon. Cap’n Crumbie tells
me there are lots of people who inquire for the
ferry in the summer. He says there never has
been one, but that is no reason why there
shouldn’t be one now. Perhaps I wouldn’t
make <em>lots</em> of money at it, but I’m old enough to
help you a bit, and I don’t want to loaf all
through vacation, because I know you’ve had
worry enough and that you’re going to have
a tough time keeping me in school until I finish.”</p>

<p>“Well?” observed Samuel Holden, rather
vaguely.</p>

<p>“I was wondering,” continued the boy,
“whether you could manage somehow to buy
me the sort of boat I’d need. Almost anything
would do that was half-way decent—and
clean, too, because summer folk wouldn’t want
to get into her if she wasn’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden shook his head slowly. “I dare
say it might work out all right, Jack,” he said,
“and a little more money would come in very
handy, but you’d better get the notion out of
your head, son, before you waste any more time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
thinking about it. I couldn’t afford to buy you
even a dory, and it’s about six times too far
across the water at that point to row, anyway.”</p>

<p>“All right, Dad,” said Jack, quietly. He
realized that there was no use in asking his
father to perform impossibilities. Later in the
evening Mr. Holden noted an expression of
quiet determination in the lad’s face such as
he had so often seen in Mrs. Holden’s when,
things not going well, her resourceful brain
and stout heart had set themselves the task of
getting affairs back in order.</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and shortly after
breakfast, there being no school, Jack and his
chum, George Santo, started off on a hike toward
the sand-dunes and salt-flats which lay
for miles to the north of Greenport. This region
the boys had made their playground ever
since they were old enough to go about together.
It was on the bold summit of Indian
Head, a rocky barrier which for centuries had
kept the encroaching sea at bay, that they had
built their first wigwam out of driftwood, and
stood, at the mature ages of nine and ten respectively,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
adorned with feathers and armed
with spears, guarding their hunting-grounds
from the hated palefaces who never seemed to
approach much nearer than Greenport. From
there they let their eyes wander in imagination
over vast herds of buffalo, moose and antelope
grazing peacefully on a far-stretching prairie.
At times, as the hated palefaces all seemed to
be fully occupied elsewhere, phantom palefaces
had to blunder upon their hunting-grounds, and
these intruders were hastily despatched or led
captive to the driftwood wigwam, there to be
held as hostages. There were terrific battles
up on Indian Head, but somehow or other,
whatever the overwhelming odds with which
they were faced, the two lone braves invariably
came out from the encounters unscathed. But
the wigwam was now scattered to the four
winds of heaven. The boys had grown too old
for that sort of make-believe; yet their love
for the region of dunes and marsh endured.</p>

<p>On this particular morning they headed over
toward the salt-flats above Cow Creek, and
then followed the course of the Sangus River<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
toward the sea. They must have trudged half
a dozen miles by this circuitous route before
Jack, standing on the rippled summit of a
wind-swept dune, drew his companion’s attention
to the fact that the Sangus had changed
its sandy course.</p>

<p>“It must have been caused by the flood and
the last gale,” he said. “See, the water has
come right across this low bit and—and—say,
George, the old sloop, the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, was lying
nearly buried just along here. I shouldn’t
wonder if the river has swept her away now.
Come on, let’s see how the old dear is.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes’ tramping brought them to the
place, and each gave a cry of joy when they
saw that the sloop lay exactly as she had lain
for three years. But she had escaped the effects
of the recent gale by a narrow margin
only, for the Sangus had swirled over its banks,
eating its way through the sand to a new course,
until it now flowed within twenty feet of the
<i>Sea-Lark</i>.</p>

<p>The boys climbed aboard the derelict, and
with their legs dangling over the side, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
healthy appetites attacked a parcel of sandwiches.</p>

<p>“I’m glad she’s still here,” said Jack.
“Do you remember when I was a pirate king
last summer and made you walk the plank?
We’ve had lots of fun on this sloop. If she’d
been lying a mile or so nearer Greenport,
crowds of kids would have been swarming all
over her and she’d have been broken up.”</p>

<p>George nodded, and poked the last of the
sandwiches into his mouth.</p>

<p>“Talking of boats,” Jack went on, “where
do you suppose I could get one, George?”</p>

<p>“What do you want her for? There’s my
dory. You can have that any time you
want.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, George,” Jack replied. “But a
dory isn’t just what I <em>do</em> want.”</p>

<p>Then he explained.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I guess a boat like that, one
you could use for a ferry, would cost money,”
declared the other, when Jack had finished.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe, your father being a boat-builder,
you might know of some way I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
manage it,” said Jack. “There’s plenty of
time, because it’s early in the season yet, and
maybe I’ll find what I want somewhere.”</p>

<p>“If you do start the ferry I want to help.
May I?” asked George.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be skipper and I’ll be mate,” said
George, laughing.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t laugh at the captain—that is,
not after you’re properly appointed mate—”
said Jack, “or I’ll order you put in irons.
That’s what they always do. Yes, laugh now,
if you like, but wait till I’m your captain.
But why wait? See here, George Santo,
weren’t you making an application to me for a
job just now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied George, meekly touching
his cap.</p>

<p>“How old are you?” This, brusquely, as
befitting a fearsome master mariner.</p>

<p>“Fifteen, sir.”</p>

<p>“Umph! Pretty young for my class of
trade. What’s your rating?”</p>

<p>“Chief mate, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>“Got your certificate?”</p>

<p>“I left it at home, sir.”</p>

<p>“Umph! Very careless of you. Well, you
want to sail with me, eh? What about the compass?
Can you box it?”</p>

<p>“I’m a pretty fair boxer, sir.”</p>

<p>“Not that sort of boxing, chump! All right,
you’re engaged. <em>Now</em>, Mr. Mate, laugh at me
if you dare!”</p>

<p>Whereupon the mate promptly laughed, and
Jack as promptly hurled him overboard into
the raging billows of sand. Jack then strolled
aft and stood for a few moments, measuring
the distance between the embedded sloop and
the river.</p>

<p>The mate, clambering aboard again, shouted
something which fell on deaf ears. Again
George spoke, and again Jack made no answer.
At last, however, he emerged from his abstraction,
and, “Come here,” he called.</p>

<p>George obeyed, and Jack passed his arm
through that of his friend.</p>

<p>“Now, use your brain,” he said. “How far
is it from here to the stream?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“Thirty feet,” the other guessed. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Wrong. It’s nearer twenty. And don’t
ever ask the captain ‘why’ anything. He’s in
supreme command; see? Tell me what is to
prevent us digging the <i>Sea-Lark</i> out of this and
getting her afloat.”</p>

<p>“Afloat!” gasped the mate. “Why, you
can’t do it! She’s stuck here.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I do it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” began the mate, dubiously.</p>

<p>“You’ll be disrated if you don’t use more
intelligence,” snapped the skipper. “What are
shovels for but to dig with?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—” began George.</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you got her afloat she’d only sink.
Her timbers will all be rotten.”</p>

<p>“Show me a rotten timber!” said Jack. “I
don’t mean these planks that have got broken
on deck. I mean in the hull. She’s as sound
as a bell. A boat like this would take years
and years to rot. She’d need some calking, I
guess, but that’s what I engaged you for, isn’t
it?—while I sit in my deck chair and give orders.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
George, honestly, I believe it could be
done.”</p>

<p>“But she isn’t yours to float,” parried the
mate, “nor to use after you get her afloat.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” agreed the skipper, frowning.
“But you have got a way of raising difficulties
since I signed you on. Who does she
belong to?”</p>

<p>“She used to belong to Mr. Farnham,” replied
George. “He’s a New York man with
pots of money, who lives over on the Point in
the summer. The sloop was in my father’s
boat-yard for repairs the summer before she
broke away and got stranded here.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you suppose he wants her? I don’t
believe so.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” observed George, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, if he does want her, why doesn’t he
come and get her? And what could he use her
for? A coal cellar, or what? She’s abandoned,
I tell you.”</p>

<p>“If you took her away from here, which you
couldn’t do, anyway,” observed the younger
boy, “you’d be committing ship theft.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“It’s a dreadful offense, worse than piracy.
I believe they hang you for it, or something.”</p>

<p>“I certainly don’t want you to get hanged,”
said the captain. “Good mates are scarce; and
they always hang the mate, because he’s engaged
to make himself useful in little ways like
that. But it wouldn’t be ship theft if I wrote
a letter to this Mr. Farnham and got his permission,
would it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“My dad will have his address.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t forget to ask him for it, and
I’ll write. He can only refuse.”</p>

<p>George, beginning to awake to the possibilities
of the plan, cast a more critical eye over
the stranded sloop.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if you were right,”
he said at length. “We <em>might</em> get her into the
water.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be exactly easy, because she’s
pretty big,” Jack admitted, “but it would be
worth trying, anyway. What a prize if we got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
her, though! She’s thirty foot over all, if
she’s an inch. And ten—no, twelve-foot beam.
The only thing is, if she did float, we couldn’t
row her very well.”</p>

<p>“There’s bales of junk gear up at our yard,”
put in George. “I suppose her mast got broken
off in the gale when she stranded. I think I
could get that fixed all right, though. There’s
an old spar that came out of her when she was
refitted. I don’t know why it was taken out,
but it looks all right. We can find an old mainsail
and jib somewhere. Even if they need a
bit of patching, they’ll do.”</p>

<p>“The boat is the chief thing,” Jack mused.
“The rest will be easy, once we get her. I’m
going to send that letter off to-day. Let’s go
home now and do it.”</p>

<p>Letter-writing was not an occupation which,
ordinarily, filled Jack with joy. But this was
not an ordinary occasion. After a first attempt
which he regarded as a failure, the boy produced
a missive that was both frank and polite,
and then, feeling that he did not stand a ghost
of a chance of having his request granted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
posted it. Later, he and George walked to the
boat-yard, there to consult George’s father,
Tony Santo, on the question of moving the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
from her sandy bed. Tony promised to
go down the river and look the sloop over, the
following day, and was as good as his word.
Jack and George accompanied him in his sailing-dory,
and to the delight of the boys the
boat-builder declared that there ought not to
be a great deal of difficulty in getting the sloop
off, though he cautiously declined either to have
anything to do with such operations or allow
his son to, unless definite permission was received
from Mr. Farnham. He pointed out,
however, that the accumulation of sand in the
sloop’s cabin would have to be removed before
any attempt could be made at shifting her.
Her companionway door had evidently been
open when she grounded, with the result that
in the three years which had since elapsed the
space below deck, a roomy cabin twelve feet
by nine, had been half filled with the fine white
sand.</p>

<p>During the next three days the boys, taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
a shovel with them, employed themselves busily
at this task until the last of the undesired ballast
was removed. Jack now began to keep an
anxious lookout for the postman. Four days
elapsed, and still no reply arrived. Thursday
came, and on returning from school he found an
envelope bearing his name, on the mantel-shelf.
His fingers unsteady with excitement, he tore
it open and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:<br></p>

<p>I thought my old sloop must have been broken up
by now. Yes, she is still my property, and if you
want her you are welcome to her, on one condition.
If you get her afloat, you must take me for a sail in
her some day.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours sincerely,</p>

<small>BACK TO THE WATER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Stuffing the letter into a pocket, Jack
reached for his cap, and hurried out to
summon his crew, consisting of George Santo.</p>

<p>“All hands on deck!” he said. “Mr. Mate,
we’re going to start work right away. There
are only three weeks of May left, and before
long we’ll have Holden’s Ferry going.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” replied the mate, “if ever
we <em>do</em> get her floated.”</p>

<p>“<em>If!</em>” cried Jack. “You talk like a codfish.
Of <em>course</em> we’re going to get her floated! Before
we do another thing, though, I’m going
to hold a war council with your dad. He knows
best how we can tackle the job.”</p>

<p>They hurried to the boat-builder’s yard,
where Tony was found at work.</p>

<p>“Mr. Farnham has given me that sloop,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Jack cried as he approached. “See, here’s his
letter.”</p>

<p>Tony’s features developed a broad smile, and
he glanced through the note.</p>

<p>“So you’ll soon be setting off on a journey
around the world, or thereabouts, eh?” he remarked
at last, banteringly.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe about half-way, or perhaps as
far as Greenport breakwater,” Jack returned;
“but you know, Mr. Santo, we can’t do much
till we get your help.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want me to do?” asked
Tony good-humoredly, putting down his hammer.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to bother you too much,” said
Jack, “but you said that if we got stuck you
would give us a bit of help.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I’ll run over there in the dory
some Saturday and help you to launch her,
when you’re ready.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. That will be a tremendous help.
Shall we dig a channel down to the water and
float her out that way, or dig the sand away
from her bow—she is lying bow-on toward the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
river, you know—and get her out with a
winch?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a winch. That will be easier. I’ll
find a place on the opposite bank of the river
where I can moor the winch, and then run a
cable across the water to the sloop. We’ll
drag her out when you’ve done enough spade-work.
But mind, you want to get all that sand
clear away from her sides, and make a nice
slope up from her bow so that she won’t stick
when the winch begins to haul on her. How
long will that take you? Till next fall?”</p>

<p>“I hope not. We couldn’t very well manage
it by next Saturday. That would only give us
two days. But we’ll be ready for the winch
the Saturday after.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Tony. “We’ll make
that a date.”</p>

<p>To any one less enthusiastic than her proud
new owner, the sloop would not, perhaps, have
looked such a priceless possession. There is
something peculiarly desolate about the appearance
of a wreck at any time, and, at least up
to the time when the Sangus had again changed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
its course, the <i>Sea-Lark</i> had looked even more
desolate than she would otherwise have done,
because she was so far from the river. The
water had left her canting over heavily to port,
her stump of mast, a yard long, sticking up.
On the port side her deck was now about level
with the sand; her starboard side, raised four
or five feet higher, had formed a barrier against
which a solid bank of the restless sand had
settled. Had she been an old boat and needing
paint at the time she came to grief, decay might
have left its stamp upon her in the three years
she had lain there; but it so happened that her
oaken beams and hard-pine planking were as
sound at the time of the accident as on the day
when they were first put into her, while the
fact that she had received a double coat of
paint only two months before, helped her further
to resist the weather. She was not, therefore,
really a wreck, as nothing of any consequence,
except the mast, was broken.</p>

<p>Taking turn and turn about, the two boys
worked strenuously, first removing the sand
that had silted up against her starboard side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
It was no light task, for the drift ran the whole
length of the sloop, and the lads’ backs were
aching and their limbs weary before they
seemed to have made any impression on it.
When the skipper called a final halt, however,
they were well pleased with the result of their
arduous labors. Nevertheless, Jack realized
now for the first time how great was the task
he had set himself, and how hopeless would be
his efforts without the kindly assistance of Tony
with the winch.</p>

<p>In three days the boys had entirely removed
the drift, and then began to dig down around
the sides of the vessel, to release her from the
grip of the sand there. George proved not only
a willing but an extremely useful helper.
Though not so tall as his chum, he was strong,
and gave promise of developing into an unusually
powerful man. But it was the spirit
with which he threw himself into the task that
Jack appreciated as much as anything. Just
before the date of the appointment with Tony,
once when they were resting, perched on the
side of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, George surveyed the piles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of sand which they had removed in the past
week.</p>

<p>“We only want one thing now,” he said
thoughtfully, “to make us both thoroughly
happy.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“A peach of a wind-storm, to fill up all the
holes we’ve been digging! If that happened, I
don’t believe we’d have the pluck to start all
over again.”</p>

<p>“Don’t suggest such an awful thing,” cried
Jack, “or I’ll smite you with a belaying-pin!
By the way, George, I can’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>am</em> so sorry!” said the other. “Why
not?”</p>

<p>“Because there doesn’t seem to be a belaying-pin
on board. We’ll need one or two,
won’t we? The skipper always thumps people
on the head with a belaying-pin, particularly
the mate. There’s something about a marlinespike,
too, isn’t there? I’m not quite sure
what a marlinespike is, but I think I club you
with it when there isn’t a belaying-pin handy.”</p>

<p>With a deft movement of his body, the mate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
got behind the skipper and neatly tipped him
overboard into the hole they had so painstakingly
dug; nor was the captain allowed to climb
on board again until the mate had extracted a
promise that he would at all times be treated
in a humane manner when they were far out on
the bounding ocean.</p>

<p>During the last of the preparations for
Tony’s operations their spirits rose greatly, for
it began to look as though the sloop merely
needed a gentle tug to slide her away from the
bed in which she had so long lain. At school
on Friday Jack struggled hard to keep his attention
riveted on his lessons, but it was an
effort in which he failed utterly; for the launching
on the morrow of the good ship <i>Sea-Lark</i>
seemed a matter of infinitely greater importance
than the problems that were put before
him.</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon when the boy
finally declared that all was ready for the great
ceremony. He and his chum had carried out
Tony’s instructions to the letter, even searching
about on the bank of the river for driftwood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
which they dragged to the sloop and
placed in position just under her nose. That
night Tony was informed of their readiness for
his part in the program, and the boat-builder
bade them be prepared for an early
start next day, as it might take until late in
the afternoon to get through.</p>

<p>Not very long after sunrise next day Jack
leaped from bed and looked anxiously out at
the window. It seemed as though the Fates
were going to be kind to him, because the
weather was perfect for the day’s operations.
The boy was too impatient to eat much breakfast,
and after a hurried meal went round to
the Santo boat-yard, where he found Tony and
George already moving the necessary gear into
the sailing-dory—much strong manila rope with
blocks and tackle, a powerful hand-winch, several
heavy planks, a number of rollers, and a
bucket of grease. When these were aboard,
the sail was hoisted, and the dory dropped
down the creek to the river. There, as the
stream was not over wide, the oars had to be
used, and the dory was rowed some four miles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Tony pulling steadily all the time, and the
boys taking turn and turn about at the other
oar.</p>

<p>“It’s hard work against the wind,” said
Tony, “but we shall feel the benefit of it coming
back.”</p>

<p>It was only a little after nine o’clock when
they reached the spot where the <i>Sea-Lark</i> lay,
and some hours were left before high water
was due. First Tony went ashore and inspected
the work the boys had already done.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” he declared unhesitatingly.
“She ought to come off like a wet fish slides
off a plate. Lend a hand with those rollers and
boards in the dory, and we’ll fix her.”</p>

<p>Already Tony seemed to take as keen an interest
in the salvage operations as the boys had
done. He soon had everything ready on that
bank of the Sangus, and then crossed the river
to moor the winch in the sand there, so that it
would haul without moving. This was not easily
accomplished, for the loose sand gave poor
anchorage. When, however, it was done to his
satisfaction, the cable was run across the water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
and made fast to the sloop. Tony sent the boys
back to start hauling, while he stood by the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
to “navigate” her. Jack and his chum
each seized a crank and began to tighten the
cable. It came easily enough until the drag
of the sloop began. Then they managed a bare-half-turn
only. Putting forth every ounce of
their strength, they struggled to start the sloop
on her journey toward the water, but it was beyond
them. The <i>Sea-Lark</i> refused to glide with
fairy footsteps down to the river after her long
rest ashore. Tony meanwhile was heaving at
the side of the boat to loosen her keel in the
sand, but when he saw the joint efforts of the
boys were unequal to the task, he beckoned
them to fetch the dory across.</p>

<p>“She seems to be glued there,” he declared,
“but that glue will have to come unstuck, if it
takes us the whole day to do the trick. Let’s
see if all three of us working at the winch can
get her to start.”</p>

<p>Tony rolled up his sleeves, put the boys together
at one crank, and applied his own
strength to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Now, lads,” he said, “give her all you’ve
got. Heave!”</p>

<p>There was a back-breaking moment of straining,
cracking muscles.</p>

<p>And then something happened. The <i>Sea-Lark</i>
reluctantly began to move.</p>

<p><em>Click-click-clickety-click</em>, went the winch.</p>

<p>“Easy, now,” ordered Tony. “Rest a few
minutes. She’ll come all right, and we have
plenty of time.”</p>

<p>From that moment the launching of the sloop,
though slow, was a certainty. A dozen times
Tony had to make the trip across the river to
adjust the planks and rollers beneath the boat’s
keel, but she came up the slope without mishap.</p>

<p>“My word, she looks big!” Jack exclaimed
when he had climbed to the top and was lumbering
along on her side, down to the water’s
edge.</p>

<p>“What did you take her for?—a canoe?”
Tony laughed. “She won’t look as big, though,
when she gets into the water. Still, a thirty-foot
sloop is all you two will want to handle
in a breeze.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>When their prize was within a foot of the
water, Tony went over her with a calking-iron
and mallet, plugging up the worst of the leaky
places with oakum so that she could safely be
taken up the river as far as the boat-yard without
danger of sinking on the way. Jack
watched this performance with a critical eye.</p>

<p>“Is she very bad?” he asked with some
anxiety.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” replied Tony. “She’s not what
you might call seaworthy, with these seams wide
open, but you’re bound to get that. I didn’t
expect to have much trouble with her hull, and
I must say that, considering all things, she’s
in pretty fair condition. Just the same, I
guess there’s enough work on her to keep you
busy for a week or so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it takes us all summer! Yes,
I do, too,” said Jack. “I want to get her
shipshape in a month or so if possible.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not saying you can’t do that,”
replied Tony, surveying the hull with a professional
gaze. “But let me tell you this: you’ve
got your work cut out; that is, if you mean to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
put her into first-class shape. Still, even as she
is she’d fetch a nice little sum, once we get her
down to the yard where people come looking for
boats.”</p>

<p>“It’s very nice to hear you say that, Mr.
Santo,” replied Jack, “but I feel as proud of
her already as though she were a steam-yacht,
and it would have to be a very tempting offer
to make me part with her.”</p>

<p>“There!” said Tony at last. “I think she’ll
do now. Some water is bound to slop into her
on the way home, but she won’t go back on us
and sink, anyway. Let’s get her launched.”</p>

<p>A few more turns on the winch fetched the
<i>Sea-Lark</i> down into the river, and Jack could
not suppress a shout when he saw her actually
afloat. She did not look quite so large as when
lying high and dry on the top of the bank, but
she was a fair-sized craft.</p>

<p>A tow-rope was fastened from her to the
dory, and then the smaller boat’s sail was
hoisted, Tony going alone in his dory, the boys
traveling on the sloop to steer. This was a
somewhat delicate operation, for the channel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
was narrow in places, and there were several
bends. During this part of the run the mate
stood in the bow, armed with a long pole, to
ease her prow away from the occasional shallows
into which they ran, and Jack remained at
the wheel, glowing with pride in his new possession.
For, helpless though she was without
spars, rigging, or gear, she was his, and
it was not difficult for him to adorn her with
imaginary sails bellying to the wind as she
careened over, leaving a foamy trail astern.
It seemed almost unbelievable to him that such
a thing as this could have happened. Never,
during the time when he and his friend had
played at being pirates on the sloping deck of
the stranded derelict, had he dreamed that the
day would come when the water would be flowing
beneath her keel once more and that the
hand which steadied her wheel would be his.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, there!” he called gaily to the mate.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” responded George, glancing
astern, over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Shin up aloft and put a two-reef in the maintops’l,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the skipper barked, endeavoring to imitate
the deep tones of Cap’n Crumbie.</p>

<p>Deserting his post for a moment, George ran
to the mast stump, and clung to it like a bear
hugging a pole.</p>

<p>“Belay, there!” shouted Jack, laughingly.
“Get back on to your job, or—”</p>

<p>The skipper never completed his sentence.
Slipping quickly back to the nose of the boat,
George arrived there at the precise moment
when the <i>Sea-Lark</i> ran upon one of the numerous
shallows which threatened to impede her
progress all along the route. The sloop came
to a standstill with a jerk, and George, his
hands outstretched to grasp his pole once more,
took a graceful dive straight over the side.
He could swim like a young otter, but there was
no need for that, as the water came up only to
his chest, and he soon climbed back on board,
there to withstand the playful taunts of his
father and of the captain, who condemned him
to twenty years’ imprisonment in the chain-locker
and ordered him to be deprived of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
wages for life, for absenting himself from the
ship without leave.</p>

<p>Together the lads managed to push the sloop
off again, and the journey was resumed, but
soon they reached the bend bringing them into
Cow Creek, and there the dory’s sail again became
useless, so it was lowered and Tony and
George rowed the rest of the distance, the exercise
preventing the boy from suffering any
ill effects from his ducking. George was nevertheless
thankful by the time they approached
his father’s boat-yard, for the sloop hung behind
like a load of lead, the wind, which was
now against her, adding to the work. She was
gently eased up on to the bank of the stream,
there to lie until her various minor ailments had
been attended to and until she was declared fit
for a new career of adventure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>THE TRIAL TRIP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Immediately after school on the following
Monday afternoon Jack and his chum
hastened to what they were pleased to call their
“dry-dock.” Although Tony Santo had calked
the worst of the cracks between the planks under
the sloop’s water-line before he actually
launched her, she had taken in a good deal of
water during her journey along the Sangus
River and up Cow Creek. It was obvious,
therefore, that several afternoons would be
taken up with the task of filling the numerous
small crevices along her hull, although the boat-builder
assured them that the swelling of the
wood after she had been afloat a few days would
to some extent remedy this trouble.</p>

<p>The boys went about their task in a thoroughly
businesslike manner. With coats off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and shirt-sleeves rolled up, and wearing the oldest
trousers they could find, they applied themselves
diligently and intelligently to their work.
Tony, who took a genuine interest in the affair,
devoted an hour or two to them on the first
day, teaching the boys how to use the calking-iron
and mallet, how to lay the thin strip of
oakum along the defective seam, and how to
ram it into the cavity without injuring the boat
itself. Also, they learned to distinguish between
a seam which needed calking and one
which did not.</p>

<p>After putting them through their short apprenticeship,
the boat-builder sat on an upturned
box, lighted his pipe with deliberation,
and for a while watched his pupils at work.</p>

<p>“Steady, there!” he said. “Don’t try to go
too fast. You’re not out to make a record.
Not too hard with the mallet, or you may do
more harm than good. That’s the style!”</p>

<p>As the tide had receded it had left the vessel
canting over on her starboard side, and Tony
had told the repair gang to take one seam at a
time, working from stem to stern as far as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
possible, for the <i>Sea-Lark</i> was high and dry
only at low water.</p>

<p>“Now I guess you’re all right, and I’ll
leave you to it,” said Tony at length. “How
long are you going to keep it up?”</p>

<p>“Till supper-time,” replied Jack, tapping
away industriously with the mallet in his right
hand, while with his left he held up the small
iron which rammed the oakum home.</p>

<p>“You’ll be wanting some paint for this boat
soon,” said Tony, with a mysterious smile.
“Now, if you keep on with what you’re doing
till it’s time to knock off for supper, I’ll—I’ll
make you a present of all the paint you need.”</p>

<p>Jack, wondering what the joke was, turned to
the boat-builder.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” he asked. “What’s
the catch?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out,” replied Tony. “What
does that mallet weigh?”</p>

<p>“About four pounds,” guessed Jack.</p>

<p>“Three and a half,” said Tony. “And what
does that other little thing—the iron—weigh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a quarter of a pound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Just right,” said Tony. “Now, which arm
will get tired first, the one you are holding the
mallet with, or the one you’re using for the
iron?”</p>

<p>“Which do you think, George?” asked the
skipper, with caution.</p>

<p>“Why, the mallet arm,” suggested George
promptly. “That thing weighs about ten times
as much as the iron.”</p>

<p>“That’s my guess too,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, well, we’ll see,” said Tony, the smile
having developed into a broad grin as he sauntered
off to his own work in the near-by boat-yard.</p>

<p>For a while the boys were too intent on their
occupation to carry on much conversation.
They worked side by side, each taking a separate
seam, and each glancing occasionally at
the work of the other.</p>

<p>“Have you ever done any calking before?”
Jack asked when they had been plugging at it
for some time.</p>

<p>“Not a calk!” replied the youthful mate.</p>

<p>“It’s fun, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“Lots!” replied George. “Which arm are
you having most of the fun in—the right or the
left?”</p>

<p>Jack stole a glance at his companion, who
was now standing with both his arms hanging
down.</p>

<p>“Your dad said this little iron only weighed
four ounces,” observed Jack, lowering the implement,
and rubbing his shoulder. “What’s
happened to the thing? It seems to weigh more
than the mallet now.”</p>

<p>Just then Tony strolled back and caught them
both resting.</p>

<p>“Are you going to buy that paint, or am I?”
he asked quizzically.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’ll have to be me,” replied
Jack. “I could keep on with the hammering,
but it’s holding up this little iron all the time
that bothers me.”</p>

<p>“It tries anybody, men included, at first,”
said Tony. “Don’t do too much to-day and
then you won’t be too stiff to work to-morrow.
You’ll soon get used to it, though. There’s
a lot of scrubbing to be done on the deck, so I’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
switch off and get busy with the soap and water
for a change.”</p>

<p>The inside of the cabin was just as the boys
had finished scraping it out with a shovel, so
here considerable time had to be spent before
a coat of paint could be put on the woodwork.
Where the paint was coming from Jack, so far,
had not the least notion. He had already discovered,
to his dismay, that paint was an extremely
expensive article for one whose total
capital did not touch the five-dollar mark, especially
when pounds and pounds of the stuff
were needed to put even a single coat on sparingly.
There were precisely two reasons why
he would not attempt to get the necessary
money by borrowing from George. One was
that he had a constitutional dislike to borrowing.
The other was that George would be unable
to lend it; for George had not yet learned
the wisdom of reserving a little of his spending-money
for a rainy day. There was a way out
of the difficulty, of course, for the skipper of
the <i>Sea-Lark</i>. He could find a job somewhere.
But that would take precious time. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
prepared to do it if necessary, but hated the
idea of postponing the preparation of the sloop
for her maiden voyage until he could earn
enough money to give her a new “dress.”
However, there was plenty to occupy his attention
for the present, and he was an incurable
optimist, so he felt convinced the paint would
roll up in some unexpected fashion, after all.</p>

<p>Next day both Jack and the mate were stiff
in the shoulder, but they set to work as early as
possible in the afternoon, doing an hour’s calking
first and then turning to with the scrubbing-brushes.
There were two sleeping-bunks besides
lockers in the cabin, all of which had to
be swabbed down and then scrubbed. In the
middle of this performance, while Jack was on
his knees, working away in a corner, he noticed
that the sound of the other scrubbing-brush had
ceased, and turned to ascertain the cause. He
discovered his henchman lying, apparently fast
asleep, in one of the bunks.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Are you all right,
George?” he asked anxiously, springing to his
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that?” queried George, as
though just awakened from deepest slumber.</p>

<p>“Tired?” asked the skipper.</p>

<p>“Why, no; not specially,” replied his chum.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea, then? Come on.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve just remembered something,” replied
George. “I signed on this ship as chief
mate, didn’t I? Well, the chief mate is the
navigating officer, isn’t he? I’ve got to know
all about the currents and the rocks and charts
and stars, and nothing was said, when I was engaged,
about me having to scrub the—”</p>

<p>“George Santo,” the skipper began in his
best deep voice, “if you’re not out of that in
ten seconds you’ll know more about stars than
you’ve ever seen in your life. I’m going to
empty this bucket of water over that bunk when
I say three. One—two—”</p>

<p>With a second to spare, the mate displayed
remarkable agility in descending, and became
desperately busy once more, to avoid the captain’s
wrath.</p>

<p>It was a full week before the last of the calking
was done, and Tony, after a careful inspection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
declared it to be perfectly satisfactory.
He added a touch here and there where a little
more oakum was needed, and then provided a
bucket of tar and a brush, telling Jack to daub
her hull over completely, beneath the water-line.</p>

<p>Although still far from being finished, the
<i>Sea-Lark</i> began to assume the part of a real
boat in Jack’s estimation. She was no longer
the leaky old sieve which he and George had
played on through two summers. He was realizing,
for the first time in his life, the real satisfaction
which comes from conscientious labor.
The calking of those leaks in the seams had been
done with infinite care and at the cost of many
an ache and pain. His hands were blistered
and calloused from work to which he was not
accustomed, but it was with a growing sense of
pride in his handiwork that he viewed the sloop.
At times he was a little impatient, for the days
were rushing past and June was fast approaching,
but nevertheless he did not shirk any of
the harder toil which he might have left half
done. It was his firm determination that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
boat should be as satisfactory as he could make
her. Nor, despite his joking, was George Santo
inclined to skip the less pleasant portions of
their task.</p>

<p>After the bottom of the sloop had been tarred,
and the whole of the deck and cabin scrubbed,
Jack, on the advice of Cap’n Crumbie, invested
in a bundle of sandpaper, and another three
days were spent scraping and smoothing down
the woodwork, which had become roughened
in places by long exposure. Cap’n Crumbie
walked from the wharf to see how they were
getting on with the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, and Jack took
him into consultation on the pressing subject of
paint.</p>

<p>The watchman meditatively ran a stubby
forefinger through his whiskers.</p>

<p>“Aye, she’s bleached for fair,” he said.
“She won’t sail no better with paint on her
woodwork, but she’ll look a world different.
As you say, though, paint’s expensive, and it’ll
take a tidy bit to give her even one thin coat.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t have to be the <em>best</em> kind of
paint, Cap’n,” Jack said. “If only I could get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
hold of some old stuff, it would do. I’m not so
very particular about the color.”</p>

<p>“<em>I’ve</em> got it!” cried the watchman, suddenly,
beaming. “You go up and see Dan Staples, the
house-painter. Tell him I sent you, and he’ll
fix you up all right. I remember now they’ve
got a tub up there where they throw all the
old dried-up skins and bits of waste paint,
same as they do in all paint shops. It won’t
cost you much. I guess he’ll be able to let you
have all you want for about a dollar. It’ll be
a bit o’ trouble, but as you ain’t too particular
about the color, you couldn’t get anything better
to suit you. Put it in an old pan and melt
it over a fire. Then strain it, and you’ll have
as good paint as you’d want. Maybe it’ll be
reddish, or maybe it’ll be grayish; and maybe
you won’t be able to find a name for it; but
that won’t break your heart, huh?”</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” said Jack. “I’ll go up and
see him now.”</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Sea-Lark</i> found Mr. Staples
in his workshop, and when Jack explained
his mission the painter filled a generously sized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
can with scraps and skins out of the tub, for
which Jack paid him fifty cents.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon was devoted to the
task of melting this down over a small stove
in the boat-yard, and after straining it the boys
found they had many pounds of a brownish-colored
paint, a little nondescript as to hue, perhaps,
but nevertheless, as Cap’n Crumbie had
prophesied, perfectly good paint. The tarring
along the sides of the sloop below the water-line
had been finished off evenly, and the boys
now proceeded to slap a coat of the Staples
mixture from the top of the black line to the
top of the low rail which ran the full length
of the <i>Sea-Lark’s</i> deck; and by the time this
had been accomplished the sloop was indeed
transformed into something of her old glory.
Jack would have turned next to the painting
of the cabin and the deck itself, but here Tony
wisely interfered.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to do that till the rough
work’s all finished,” he said, “or everything
will get scratched up. I’ve got the mast to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
put in, and there’s a week’s carpentering ahead
of you yet. You’ll want two or three new
cleats. And what about belaying-pins?
They’re all gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we must have at least <em>one</em> belaying-pin!”
exclaimed Jack, with a humorous glance
at the mate. “Tell me, Mr. Santo, aren’t they
the little round sticks that go into the mast rail
there, to belay the halyards on?”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea; but they’ve all got lost.
You can easily make them.”</p>

<p>“And I want the marlinespike,” chirped
George. “I think every mate should have at
least one of those if the captain is going to have
half a dozen belaying-pins.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what a marlinespike is?” queried
Tony, puzzled.</p>

<p>“It’s something a sailmaker uses, isn’t it?”
asked George.</p>

<p>“Yes, a metal spike about six or seven inches
long.”</p>

<p>“Just what I need!” said George.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s enough carpentering work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
to keep you busy for a while,” said Tony, “unless
you’re more handy with tools than George
is.”</p>

<p>“George Santo,” said Jack, severely, when
they were alone a moment later, “you’re a
fraud, and I could have you arrested.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked George, with a grin.</p>

<p>“You shipped on this vessel as a fully qualified
mate and highly skilled carpenter. You
heard what your own father said about you.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I needed the money,” pleaded
George.</p>

<p>“This company is run on business lines, Mr.
Mate,” declared the captain. “You’ll either
learn to do your share of carpentering right
now or I’ll sue you for false pretenses.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, when I go across in the ferry
as mate do I have to pay ten cents fare, too?”
asked George.</p>

<p>“Silence!—or I’ll clap you in irons!” roared
the skipper. “Come on, and use your head.
I’ve never made a cleat in my life, and I suspect
you know more about that sort of thing
than I do. Let’s make a start.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>Two or three short pieces of oak were found
in the boat-shed, and after the third or fourth
attempt the boys managed to fashion sufficient
serviceable cleats to replace those which had
been broken. The rail also was repaired, although
Tony’s professional opinion of the way
that job had been done was not startlingly complimentary.</p>

<p>“It looks like a piece of George’s work,” he
said. “Now, ’fess up, who did it?”</p>

<p>“We’re both guilty,” explained Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a pretty difficult thing to do unless
you’re a regular ship’s carpenter,” admitted
Tony. “It’ll pass, for the present, but
some day soon, when I have time, I’ll fix it
properly for you.”</p>

<p>The boys cut the belaying-pins out of oak,
and then little remained for them to do until
the expert services of Tony had been called in.
The most important part of his share was to
place in her again the sloop’s old discarded
mast, a good, serviceable spar which towered to
a height of thirty-five feet.</p>

<p>“It’s as high as anything you could want,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
said Tony. “That mast did service in her for
two years, till Mr. Farnham got the notion into
his head that he wanted a bigger spread of
canvas on her. Lucky for you lads this
mast wasn’t five or ten feet longer, or
I should have used it in another boat long
ago.”</p>

<p>“What about a mains’l and a jib, Dad?” suggested
George. “You’ve got plenty of junk
lying around in the shed. May we use what
we need?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about that, son,” replied
Tony. “I could have fixed you up, perhaps,
with some rags of sails that aren’t any
particular good, but I don’t know that I’m
specially anxious to have you two blowing about
outside the breakwater, depending on rags.
You might be all right with them, but it isn’t
wise to take any chances in a sailing-vessel.
Now, I have a couple of sails that would just
about fit this sloop after a mite of alteration.
They’re not new, and they’re not junk. I
could get about fifteen dollars for them this
summer, but if you’d like to take them and pay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
me after you’ve earned the money with your
ferry, you can have them for ten. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s great!” said Jack. “Thank
you ever so much.”</p>

<p>“All right. Call it a deal. Now, there’s a
block or two you’ll have to scare up, and halyards
and mast-hoops. You can’t go half an
inch away from shore on a sailing-trip without
all these things. Mast-hoops you needn’t
worry about. There are plenty of old ones
kicking about here. On a pinch I might even
rake out a couple of blocks. They mayn’t be
just the size you ought to have for elegance,
but you’ll get by with them. I don’t see how
you can manage without buying halyards,
though. You’ll want—oh, about four hundred
feet or so of fifteen-thread manila. I can’t
afford to give you good manila rope. It costs
money.”</p>

<p>“I have three dollars left,” put in Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, well, you won’t get enough new
manila to fit your little ship out with that, but
I dare say I can find enough second-hand halyards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
for three dollars to give you a start. If
you’ll give me a hand I’ll have a peek at those
sails now.”</p>

<p>The jib which Tony produced fitted the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
perfectly, but the mainsail had three sets
of reef-points, and it needed to be cut away
at the single reef. This operation took the
whole of a Saturday to accomplish, for there
was a considerable amount of sewing to do, and
neither Jack nor his companion proved to be
quick with the cumbersome sailmaker’s needle.
Meanwhile, however, the mast had been stepped,
and at last the sloop was really beginning to
look like her old self. Halyards were rove,
blocks put into position, a new wire jib-stay
rigged from the top of the mast to the end of
the bowsprit, and a bobstay had to be furnished.
Then a coat of paint was spread over the deck
and the rest of the woodwork. When the last
detail in the refitting of the <i>Sea-Lark</i> had been
attended to and the paint was dry, Tony Santo,
after a final survey which could hardly have
been more thorough had the sloop been a government
war-ship about to depart on her speed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
trials, declared that she was as sound as a bell
and fit to weather a young hurricane.</p>

<p>It was, without question, the proudest moment
in Jack’s life when the boat was gently
pushed off the sandy bank of Cow Creek.
Jack’s father was there to see it, having left
his bookkeeping for the occasion.</p>

<p>“I’d like to go with you on your first trip,
lad,” he said, “but I’m afraid I can’t spare the
time.”</p>

<p>Sailing was an old accomplishment for both
the captain and his young mate, but most of
their experience in that direction had been
gained in dories, which compared with taking
the <i>Sea-Lark</i> out on a trip was child’s play.
The <i>Sea-Lark</i> was not, however, too large for
two to handle. Other sloops even larger were
wont to flit about the waters of Greenport harbor
in the summer with only two persons
aboard, and there was one, fifty feet over all,
which one man usually handled alone. She,
however, was a “freak” ship, and her owner
had to dance around like a pea in a hot frying-pan
when an emergency arose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>Tony Santo accompanied the boys on their experimental
trip, partly because there was a long,
winding journey for the sloop to make down
Cow Creek, through the upper reach of the
Sangus River, and finally through the canal.
Partly, also, Tony went to make sure that they
were all right. And partly he went for the fun
of the thing, because Tony was only twenty
years older than his son, and there was enough
of the boy left in him to appreciate some of the
thrill which was stirred in the lads by this their
greatest adventure.</p>

<p>A westerly breeze was blowing, which necessitated
the sloop being towed until she came to
within about four miles of the sea, and then a
clear run lay before them. Their dory trailed
behind and Tony took the spokes of the sloop’s
wheel in his hands.</p>

<p>“Now, lads,” he said. “Let’s shake out a
bit of canvas. Mains’l first. Don’t get excited.
Take it easy. There’s plenty of time.
Both together. Heave! That’s the style. It
wasn’t so hard, after all, was it? Either one
of you will be able to do that by himself if necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
And it may be necessary too, some day.
Belay there. Make those halyards good and
secure. Now, up with the jib. Be smart, or
we’ll run her aground yet. Trim aft the jib-sheet.
That’s fine. Belay!”</p>

<p>The breeze filled the sails, and the sloop
leaned over slightly as she gathered way.
Jack’s eyes were dancing with pleasure. The
<i>Sea-Lark</i> was not only an accomplished fact
and afloat, but actually sailing. And he was
her master!</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a beauty!” he asked Tony.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair, pretty fair, I’ll admit that,”
replied the boat-builder. “You’re a lucky lad
to have her, but you’ve earned her. I dare say
Mr. Farnham would have given the sloop to
any one else if they had thought of writing to
him; only it was you who happened to think
of it, and it’s the people who think of things
who get on in this world. Now, this good-for-nothing
son of mine,” and he took George affectionately
by the ear, “never thinks of anything
except to get up in the morning and go
back to bed at night; do you, son? Come along,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Jack. I know you’re aching to get to this
wheel. I guess it’s quite safe for you to take
her now.”</p>

<p>The owner of the <i>Sea-Lark</i> exchanged places
with Tony, and the sloop ran slowly toward the
ocean under his guiding hand. The breeze was
light and steady, and she barely made three
knots an hour, but at that moment Jack would
not have exchanged places with the captain of
the finest liner afloat. The gentle swish of water
at the stern was as sweetest music to his
ears. The occasional lazy flap of the sails, the
barely perceptible swaying of the deck, the
quick turn of the prow in response to the slightest
movement of the spokes in his hands, all
were delights which he was now tasting for the
first time in his own boat.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tony, who had been watching
the expression on the captain’s face, “what
do you think of her? Was she worth the
trouble?”</p>

<p>“A thousand times!” Jack replied, devoutly.</p>

<p>After negotiating the short canal the sloop
passed into the sea, and then, running south<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
past Gull Island, headed for the end of the
breakwater and the open ocean beyond.</p>

<p>A mile off shore the breeze freshened sufficiently
to send the <i>Sea-Lark</i> bowling along at a
fair caper. The swish of water at the stern
became more pronounced. The halyards
creaked a little, and the bow responded even
more readily to a movement of the wheel. The
<i>Sea-Lark</i> had come into her own again. She
seemed like a living thing. There was joyousness
in the way she danced, as, going further
from shore, she ran into gentle undulating
swells, which kissed her as if welcoming her
back to her natural element.</p>

<p>“Let’s see you put her through a few manœuvers,”
Tony suggested. “Haul her by the
wind. I’m going to keep still and watch.”</p>

<p>“Close haul your mains’l, Mr. Mate,” ordered
Jack.</p>

<p>George sprang to obey, and in came the boom,
whereupon Jack headed away to the southwest.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” declared Tony. “You can
come closer to the wind yet. Come round till
the luff of the mains’l begins to lift. That’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the style. Now put your helm down and go
onto the other tack.”</p>

<p>“Mind your head, George!” sang out the
captain.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” responded the mate; and the
<i>Sea-Lark’s</i> nose went straight up into the wind.
The boom swung across the deck, mains’l and
jib flapping in the breeze.</p>

<p>“Stick to it. You’re all right,” cried Tony,
pleased with the skill his apprentices were displaying.
“She’ll make it if you give her
time.”</p>

<p>Farther the sloop came as the wind got to
the other side of her sails. Quickly she swung
about, and then headed straight as an arrow, on
the port tack.</p>

<p>“Now, listen here, boys,” said Tony. “The
time may come when you’ll be compelled to
jibe her in an emergency, to avoid a collision.
But I want you to promise that you’ll never
do so unless you’re compelled to, because
though it’s all right to do it now, with no wind
to speak of, and me aboard to see that nothing
happens, jibing is no sort of game for two boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
to play at in a sloop of this size. While I’m
here, though, I’d like to see you make a shot
at it. When you’re ready, Cap’n.”</p>

<p>Jack, who was on the port tack, having got
there from the starboard tack by the simple and
usual course of heading into the wind and allowing
the boat to swing over, now wanted to
run before the wind and while doing so alter
his course so that the boom swung over from
the starboard to the port side.</p>

<p>He glanced along the surface of the water
to the westward, to see there was no strong puff
of wind coming.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of a temporary lull in the
breeze, the sloop swung round harmlessly.</p>

<p>“Ease off your main sheet!” the skipper ordered.
Away ran the boom as a fresh puff
filled the sail; and the <i>Sea-Lark</i> was already
winging its way before the wind.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Tony approved.
“You’ve got the hang of it. But remember
what I say; that’s a dangerous manœuver if
there’s much of a breeze.”</p>

<p>For another hour or two the boat-builder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
continued to coach the boys in the art of sailing;
and then, as they ran toward the town,
he declared that they were not likely to come
to much harm if they promised never to go
outside the breakwater until he was able to
“certify” them as sufficiently skilled, never to
make the sheet fast with anything but a hitch
which could quickly be cast off in case of a
sudden squall sweeping down, and never to sail
without a reef taken in when the whitecaps were
making.</p>

<p>The sloop was moored at Garnett and Sayer’s
wharf, under the guarding gaze of Cap’n Crumbie,
who had promised Jack he would keep an
eye on her.</p>

<p>“I was watching you,” said that worthy a little
later to Jack. “You seem to handle her all
right. But mind you, it’s one thing to sail a
sloop on a day like this, and a song with a different
tune when there’s rough weather.”</p>

<p>Another five days remained before the summer
vacation began, and Jack spent the afternoons
making himself more proficient in the
art of handling his new craft. After coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
ashore on the last evening, he and his mate
spent an hour or two engaged in some mysterious
occupation at the Santo boat-house. They
requisitioned a saw, a hammer, tacks, part of
an old sheet, a five-cent paint-brush, and some
paint. Then they were quiet for a while, working
away by the aid of a lantern.</p>

<p>After a while Tony saw them and approached.</p>

<p>“Don’t come here yet, Dad,” urged George.</p>

<p>“What are you two young conspirators up to
now?” asked the boat-builder.</p>

<p>“We’re artists, Dad,” replied George,
chuckling. And then they were quiet again.</p>

<p>“There,” said Jack at length. “How’s
that?”</p>

<p>“It’ll fetch them, all right,” commented the
mate of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, with complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was a perfect summer morning when Holden’s
Ferry came into being. The lightest of
breezes came in from the south, leaving a bare
ripple on the placid water of Greenport harbor.
The townsfolk were only just beginning
to be astir when two figures emerged from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Santo boat-yard bearing something which might
have been a picture, judging by its shape and
size. One or two persons stared curiously as
they passed, while Cap’n Crumbie—who,
though now officially off duty with the coming
of day, was on the wharf as usual—greeted the
boys with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>“What have you got there?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>Jack turned his “picture” so that it faced
the watchman, who raised his eyebrows and
took his pipe out of his mouth while he allowed
his gaze to rest on the object. Then he threw
back his head and gave vent to a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“You’ll do, the pair o’ you!” he said. “Enterprise,
that’s what I call it. Where are you
going to put it?”</p>

<p>“On the top of the deck-house,” replied Jack,
suiting the action to the word, and then climbing
back upon the wharf to admire the effect.</p>

<p class="cap">The notice was printed with a brush on a

<p>“People can see it, anyway,” commented
George.</p>

<p>“And I saw it first, so I’ll be the first passenger,”
said Cap’n Crumbie. “When does the
ferry leave?”</p>

<p>“Right away,” replied Jack. “The moment
you step aboard I’ll see if I can knock a bit
of life into my crew. Look at him! <em>Look</em> at
him, sitting there on the top of the deck-house
laughing, and the ship crammed with a whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
passenger waiting to get across to the Point
on most important business! Watch your step,
Cap’n. Dining-saloon forward, but the cook’s
not on duty to-day, so we can’t serve meals.
Mr. Mate, let go that rope for’ard and don’t
fall overboard in front of all the passenger.
Run that mains’l up and be lively about it or,
shiver my timbers, I’ll know the reason why!
Now, Cap’n Crumbie, if you’re at all likely to
be seasick, you’d better slip down into the cabin
and take a nap. If there’s any danger, I’ll
call you.”</p>

<p>“Starboard your helm a bit,” said Cap’n
Crumbie. “The only danger I see is that
you’re like to bump into that coal-barge if you
don’t keep her away.” He put out a brawny
hand and with a slight pull on the wheel brought
the sloop further away from the collision that
had threatened as the sloop started away from
the wharf, not yet fully under control.</p>

<p>“Paint is scarce,” said Jack. “I don’t want
to lose any.”</p>

<p>“Not with bumping into one o’ Simon Barker’s
boats, you don’t,” agreed Cap’n Crumbie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
“Not that he’d ever think o’ putting paint on
the side o’ one of his ships if tar would do, but
I want to warn you right now that he’s none
too friendly. He hasn’t got over that little
affair with your father yet, though I don’t see
what <em>he’s</em> got to kick about. He was down on
our wharf yesterday, trying his best to be ugly
about this little sloop. Said she got in the way
o’ his craft, he did. He’s a misery. Don’t
you ever leave the <i>Sea-Lark</i> lying in the way o’
his rotten old boats, or she’ll get crushed for
a certainty, if he has anything to do with it.
And he’ll sure make out that it was all your
fault.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for being a passenger,” said
Jack, as the vessel edged up to the hotel landing
on the Point. “If you’re not going to stay
ashore long I will wait for you.”</p>

<p>“Ashore! I ain’t going ashore,” replied the
watchman. “I just came across to be able to
tell my great-grandchildren, when you’re an
old man, that I was the first to cross the harbor
in Holden’s Ferry. Here’s my twenty cents.
Now take me back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t take the money. We sailors always
give free passage to old shipmates,” said Jack.
“Why, we should never have had her painted
if it hadn’t been for you, Cap’n! Besides,
you’re one of the crew, in a way. Didn’t you
say you were going to keep an eye on her?
Yes, you’re our watchman. Couldn’t dream
of taking the money.”</p>

<p>“Son, I hired this ship for the trip,” replied
Cap’n Crumbie, “and when you two have gone
and drowned yourselves some fine day I don’t
want it on my conscience that there’s twenty
cents I owe you. When you’ve been at sea as
long as I have you won’t so much mind letting
people pay their fare.”</p>

<p>“All right, Cap’n,” Jack responded.
“George, half of this goes to you, for luck.
Push her off there. Wait a second. Here
comes a passenger, I believe.”</p>

<p>Walking down to the landing was a tall boy,
about Jack’s age.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, there! Going across in the ferry?”
Cap’n Crumbie hailed.</p>

<p>The prospective passenger did not reply, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
came straight to the landing, and, with a puzzled
expression, ran his eyes over the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.</p>

<p>“What have you got there?” he asked.
There was something about either the question
or the way in which it was put that rather irritated
the captain of the sloop. However, he did
not openly show his resentment.</p>

<p>“A ferry-boat, across to the town,” he replied.
“Are you coming?”</p>

<p>“Queer sort of boat to use for a ferry, isn’t
she?” asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jack, who saw nothing whatever
queer about his beloved craft. Obviously
the strange boy was one of the “summer folk,”
and city bred at that, probably knowing no more
about sailing-craft than the keeper of a dime
museum would.</p>

<p>The boy on the wharf began to laugh, and
Jack’s cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>“Are you the chap who wrote to Mr. Farnham
in New York about the <i>Sea-Lark</i>?” the
stranger asked.</p>

<p>“That,” replied the skipper with youthful
dignity, “is my business. Push off, George.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“And who might the young pup be?” asked
Cap’n Crumbie, as they sailed leisurely back to
Garnett and Sayer’s wharf. “Never seen him
before, as far as I rec’lect, and yet his face is
kind o’ familiar.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know him,” said Jack. “And if
he’s trying to be funny at the expense of this
boat, I don’t want to know him. There’s nothing
queer about her, is there, Cap’n?”</p>

<p>“Queer! I should say not! Maybe the color
o’ the paint offends his artistic eye; or then
again maybe he’s only jealous.”</p>

<p>“Well, summer visitor or not, if he doesn’t
stop trying to make fun of the sloop I’ll give
him a licking,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“Or let him come on board as a passenger,”
grinned the watchman, “and take his money,
and then drop him overboard half-way over.”</p>

<p>That morning only two other passengers
crossed in the ferry, one of them a lady who had
a small hand-bag with her and insisted on paying
Jack fifty cents for his services, and the
other a portly man who wore three diamond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
rings and, after handing Jack a quarter at the
hotel landing, waiting in the boat, apparently
as a guarantee of good faith, while the boy
hunted for change, and finished up by pocketing
the fifteen cents and complaining bitterly about
the lad running a public ferry and not being
able to change a quarter.</p>

<p>Business did not improve much during the
rest of the day, and the owner of the ferry was a
trifle disappointed.</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to be coming with a rush,”
he said to Cap’n Crumbie.</p>

<p>“For the land’s sake, give ’em a chance!” replied
the watchman. “Here you are, not in
business more than an hour or two, and complaining.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t complaining,” Jack protested.
“I was only wondering whether it was going to
be a success, after all.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you wait about five minutes till somebody
besides us gets wind o’ the ferry?” spluttered
the old man. “Give ’em time, son, give
’em time. Why, the season hasn’t half begun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
yet. Most of the cottages along the shore are
still empty. Another week or two will make a
difference; you see if it don’t.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, business did “look up” a few
days later, much to the satisfaction of both Jack
and his father. Mr. Holden, though he had
never discouraged the boy in his project, had
always been a little skeptical as to whether the
ferry would bring much grist to the mill, but he
now grew really enthusiastic, for there were
times when the <i>Sea-Lark</i> carried as many as
fifteen people at a time. To some extent Cap’n
Crumbie was responsible for the boy’s success
in the early stages of the ferry’s career, as he
rarely allowed a party of sight-seers to wander
down to his wharf without urging them to make
the trip in the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.</p>

<p>“Wunnerful sight over there on the Point,”
he would say. “You get a view from there
that ain’t equaled in all New England. Ferry-boat
won’t be more’n a few minutes, sir,
before it’s back, and it’s a fine day for a
sail.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to give you a commission,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Jack, once, after the watchman had detained
almost a boat-load of people until his
return.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t talk foolish,” replied Cap’n
Crumbie. “It’s just to keep me from gettin’
tired o’ myself. Some night maybe I’ll borrow
the sloop and take a party for a moonlight trip
round Indian Head. Meanwhile, I can’t stand
here and see you losing good money.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bargain, Cap’n Crumbie,” replied
Jack. “Any evening you want the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
you just mention it.”</p>

<p>That afternoon Jack left the hotel landing
with several passengers, including the lady
who had given him fifty cents on the first day.
She was going into the town shopping, but Jack
noticed that she stood for a moment on the
wharf before embarking, and wore a rather
anxious expression as she looked out toward a
canoe that was being paddled about in the vicinity
of Gull Island.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think the wind is a little too
strong for any one to be out there in a canoe?”
she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>The skipper glanced at the little craft bobbing
up and down in the distance.</p>

<p>“Well, it depends on how well you can handle
a canoe,” he replied. “There’s a fresh breeze,
though, and it’s kind of choppy.”</p>

<p>Jack had been thinking of taking a reef in his
mainsail, but a few moments later he was glad
he hadn’t. He had run about a cable’s length
from the landing, and the passengers were
watching a salt-bark slowly drifting to anchorage,
when his eyes happened to alight on the
canoe. It was perhaps half a mile away, and
Jack’s thoughts were on the navigation of his
own boat, but the brief glance showed him something
amiss. With a shout to George to haul
in the sheet, he put the helm hard over and jibed
the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, rather than make the turn in a
safer but slower way. There was a stiff wind
blowing, and the boom swept across the deck
with a rattle and a bang, fetching up on the
other side with a wrench. But the gear stood
the strain, and the sloop was now racing in the
direction of the canoe, which had capsized.</p>

<p>There was a sudden cry of alarm from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
lady. “He’s drowning! He’s drowning!”
Every vestige of color was gone from her face,
as, leaning forward, she stared in horror across
the water. “It’s Rodney! It’s my boy!”</p>

<p>“Lay hold of that boat-hook, George,” sang
out the captain. And then, “We’ll get him in
time, ma’am,” he added reassuringly to the distracted
mother.</p>

<p>The <i>Sea-Lark</i> leaned to the breeze and flew
on her mission of rescue. That she would arrive
none too soon was evident to all on board.
Apparently the boy in the water was no swimmer,
and his floundering efforts were barely
keeping his head above the surface. A choking
appeal for help came across the rapidly narrowing
water that intervened.</p>

<p>“Take the wheel, George!” Jack spoke
crisply, imperatively. “Keep her straight!”
As he spoke he slipped off jacket and shoes.
“<a href="#i_frontis">The moment I jump swing her ’round.</a> You,
sir,” he added, to one of the passengers, “be
ready to reach out to me with this boat-hook.”</p>

<p>Another twenty feet! Ten! And then the
boy in the water, with a despairing cry, sank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
from sight. Jack, poised at the bow, shot over
the side as the <i>Sea-Lark</i> sped past.</p>

<p>Down he went into the green depths. A
few yards away a blurred shape showed dimly
and he swam gropingly toward it. Then his
hands found what they sought and in a moment
his head was above water again. Kicking out
with all his strength, and sweeping his right
hand through the green water, he clung on to
the half-drowned canoeist with his left, until
the sloop, with fluttering sail, loomed beside
him.</p>

<p>A minute later the two dripping figures were
on the deck.</p>

<p>The canoeist opened his eyes and looked up at
the woman who was now kneeling beside him.
He tried to raise himself on his elbow, but sank
back, gasping for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mother! I—I’m all right,” he said
presently. “Just a minute, till I get my breath
back. Hope I haven’t scared you, but I—I
wasn’t going to drown.”</p>

<p>Then he sat up, somewhat limply, and looked
around. The captain, with water running from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
his clothing, was assisting George to recover
the canoe and paddle. As soon as this had been
accomplished, he turned his attention to the boy
he had rescued, and for the first time recognized
him.</p>

<p>“Well, how do you feel?” Jack asked, bearing
no ill feeling.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair, thanks,” replied the other. “I
think I’m still full up to the neck with water,
though. I’m awfully obliged to you. I tried
to catch hold of the paddle, but I couldn’t quite
make it. Then I saw your boat coming, but it
seemed ever so far away. I’d have been—” he
was going to say “drowned by now,” but
checked himself as his mother was there—“down
there yet if you hadn’t come to the
rescue.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Jack replied. “Glad to
have been able to help.” Then, as the canoeist
seemed to have almost recovered, he added:
“Only—only, just as a favor, don’t laugh at
this boat again, please!”</p>

<p>A puzzled look came into the other’s face.</p>

<p>“Laugh at her?” he queried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jack, “and you said she was
a queer sort of boat to use for a ferry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember now,” said the owner of the
canoe. “But don’t you know why it seemed
queer to me?” Jack shook his head. “Why,
you see, this was my father’s sloop, for a long
time, and all I meant was that it seemed queer
to me to see her being used as a ferry-boat. I
used to sail about in her with my dad three years
ago, and many a time I held that wheel you’re
steering with. I used to feel that she was my
boat, though of course, really, she was nothing
of the kind. My name is Rodney Farnham, and
this is my mother.”</p>

<p>Jack felt a little sheepish because of the resentment
he had shown, and after Rodney Farnham’s
frank explanation he began to reconsider
his opinion of the lad.</p>

<p>“I didn’t understand,” he said. “Sorry if
I was rude. I haven’t seen Mr. Farnham yet,
but I want to, to tell him how glad I am he gave
me the boat. I wrote to tell him I’d got her
afloat, but he didn’t reply.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“Dad’s a pretty busy man when he’s in New
York, and I guess he hasn’t had too much time
to write. You may be sure he meant to look you
up when he came down to Greenport, though,”
replied Rod. “We have a motor-boat now, and
you must come for a run in her with me some
day; but I’m jolly glad he gave you the old
<i>Sea-Lark</i>, or I might still be floating around
back there.”</p>

<p>“It was very fortunate,” Mrs. Farnham
agreed. “My husband will be doubly anxious
to see you now. I shall write to him to-night,
telling him what happened. He will probably
be with us next week.”</p>

<p>“When he comes I’d like to take you all for
a sail. That is, if you would care to go.
You’d be quite safe,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m sure we should, judging from what I’ve
seen of your seamanship to-day,” replied Mrs.
Farnham. “And it is very kind of you to ask
us. I’m sure we would all love to go with
you.”</p>

<p>When the sloop touched Garnett and Sayer’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
wharf Mrs. Farnham, on assuring herself that
Rodney was no worse after his immersion,
stepped ashore.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like to say so in front of Mother,”
remarked Rod, as soon as the sloop was heading
back toward the Point, “but that was the narrowest
escape I’ve ever had in my life. I’d
got to the stage where I didn’t know much.
By the way, I hope you’re doing good business
with the sloop.”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” replied the captain. “It was
fairly slow at first, but the town is pretty full
of visitors now, and all the cottages on the
Point are open.”</p>

<p>“It must have cost you a lot to get her fixed
up like this,” Rod said, giving the vessel a comprehensive
glance.</p>

<p>Jack smiled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>“It might have, if we hadn’t done the work
ourselves,” he replied. “George Santo, here,
helped me a lot, and we did the whole thing
ourselves, except fixing the mast and rigging, of
course.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve had her painted,” said Rod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“We did that, too,” replied the skipper. “It
cost us just fifty cents, but we got the paint at a
special bargain. The sails and halyards were
all I really had to buy, and I made almost
enough at the ferry in the first week to pay for
those.”</p>

<p>“Well, she looks splendid,” said Rod, stepping
off at the hotel landing. “And—and,
I’m awfully glad Dad gave her to you!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>

</div>


<p class="cap">Sometimes Jack had to be not only skipper
but mate also of the good ship <i>Sea-Lark</i>,
when his “crew” was otherwise engaged.
Now and then Tony Santo needed his son’s assistance
in the boat-yard. On one such occasion—it
was the day following the rescue of
Rodney Farnham—a man entered the shed and
addressed the boat-builder.</p>

<p>“Do you rent boats here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I can let you have a dory if you want to go
down the creek,” replied Tony.</p>

<p>The man shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>“Something larger than that,” he answered.
“A sailing-boat, for instance.”</p>

<p>“You can’t do much sailing on the creek,”
said the boat-builder. “Why don’t you inquire
along the wharves?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I was wondering,” was the hesitating
reply, “whether you happened to have a little
sloop—something I could handle by myself.”</p>

<p>George observed the man curiously. He did
not look like a person who would go in for sailing,
and, by the same token, he was not particularly
prepossessing. He was a little above
the average height, and his clothes, though new,
did not fit him well. His manner seemed nervous,
and he fidgeted with one of the buttons on
his coat while talking.</p>

<p>“Nothing just now,” replied Tony.</p>

<p>“Do you remember a little sloop called the
<i>Sea-Lark</i>?” asked the stranger.</p>

<p>George and his father exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” replied Tony. “Belonged to
Mr. Farnham?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the man. “What ever
became of her? If I could get her she’d be just
the sort I want.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think money would hire her,” put
in George.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” explained Tony, “these boys
have her. She ran ashore in the Sangus three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
years ago and they got her afloat a while ago
and fixed her up.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed the stranger, sharply.
“Where is she now?”</p>

<p>“She’s being used as a ferry-boat, across the
harbor.”</p>

<p>“Who owns her?” was the next query.</p>

<p>“Jack Holden. You’ll find him down on
Garnett and Sayer’s wharf with her ’most any
time.”</p>

<p>“Jack Holden, eh? If he won’t hire her he
might be willing to sell her, maybe.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t very likely, but you can go and ask
him. I guess you’ll find him down there now.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said the man laconically, and presently
went off.</p>

<p>But the stranger, though he went to the ferry,
was in no apparent hurry to tackle Jack on the
question of hiring or buying the sloop. He
stood chatting with Cap’n Crumbie on the wharf
until the <i>Sea-Lark</i> returned, and then crossed to
the Point and strolled off.</p>

<p>“That’s a rum-looking bird you took across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
just now,” commented Cap’n Crumbie, as soon
as Jack landed back.</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice him specially,” replied Jack.
“At least, not at first. He didn’t seem to be
able to keep still for more than a minute. I
noticed his hands, though, when he gave me his
fare. He must have been doing some pretty
hard work for a long time, and yet he wasn’t
dressed quite like a workman.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie grunted. He prided himself
on being able to distinguish a day tripper or a
drummer from a regular visitor on sight, and
an artist from both.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t place him. He don’t belong here,
anyway,” replied the watchman.</p>

<p>“He was cross-eyed or something, wasn’t
he?” Jack asked.</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied slowly. “I know what you
mean, though. It’s his eyes that are set too
close together. Don’t you never lend a quarter
to a feller whose eyes come as near each other as
that, Jack, ’cause it’s all New England to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
piece o’ cheese that you’ll be twenty-five cents
short from that moment on. My guess is that if
yon feller isn’t a crook o’ some sort, he’s a
mighty good imitation.”</p>

<p>The subject of the stranger was then dropped,
but an hour later Jack took especial notice of the
man when he came on board the ferry again at
the Point, to return to town.</p>

<p>“Nice little boat you’ve got here,” the man
observed.</p>

<p>“I like her very well,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“She would just about suit me. I’ve been
looking for a craft of this sort. Would you like
to rent her?”</p>

<p>“By the hour, do you mean?” Jack asked.</p>

<p>“Something like that. I only want to potter
around.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that very well,” said the captain.
“I’m fairly busy in the day time with the ferry.
I could take you out some evening, though.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can manage her by myself,” replied
the man. “You needn’t bother to come.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let her go out unless I was in
her. I wouldn’t trust her to any one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“Huh! Well, what about selling her?”</p>

<p>“Not this season,” said Jack. “I have only
just started this ferry and it looks as though I
might clean up something by the fall.”</p>

<p>“Best let me hire her,” said the man. “My
name is Martin, and I expect to be around
Greenport for a while. Look here, you needn’t
be afraid of me doing any damage to her. I’ll
promise not to take her outside the breakwater,
and of course if there <em>should</em> be any damage I’ll
make it good.”</p>

<p>Jack wavered for an instant, but only an instant.
The sloop was by far the most treasured
possession he had ever had, and the idea of
allowing some one else to run her about, perhaps
scraping her bottom against the rocks, or even
capsizing her, was distinctly distasteful. Moreover,
had not Cap’n Crumbie warned him only
a little while previously of placing much faith
in such a man? As a matter of fact, if something
did happen to the <i>Sea-Lark</i> and this man
gave him another boat in her place, it would not
be the same. He loved the <i>Sea-Lark</i> for what
she was, for what she had already done for him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
and because of the long hours of toil he had
spent in making her into what she was.</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” he said. “Any time you want
to go for a sail in the evening, after the ferry
stops running at six o’clock, I’ll take you, but
I won’t let her go otherwise.”</p>

<p>Martin shrugged, and strolled forward for a
while, after which he went below into the little
cabin, where there were one or two passengers
sitting. As the sloop neared the wharf he came
on deck again.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t forget what I’ve said,” he remarked.
“Any time you change your mind, let
me know, see?”</p>

<p>“I’m not likely to, thanks,” replied Jack,
surprised at the man’s persistence.</p>

<p>Jack and the watchman were standing together
on the wharf a few minutes afterward,
when George Santo joined them.</p>

<p>“Well, did you sell the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, Jack?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“Sell her? Who to?” replied the skipper.</p>

<p>“A man was inquiring about her,” said the
mate. “He asked us all sorts of questions at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the boat-yard, and then said he was coming
down here to make a dicker with you.”</p>

<p>“How funny!” observed the captain of the
<i>Sea-Lark</i>. “He must be crazy about her. I’m
not surprised, but I wonder why, all the
same. You didn’t tell him I wanted to sell
her?”</p>

<p>“I told him money wouldn’t buy her from
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s pretty nearly true. I don’t
like the chap. Nor does the Cap’n, here. He
worries me. George Santo, you’re fired!
Where have you been all this day? Here I’ve
been steward, and ship’s carpenter, and cook,
and deck-hand, and cabin-boy ever since eight
o’clock this morning. I wanted to see you on a
little matter of business.”</p>

<p>“If I’m fired, you can’t have any business
with me; can he, Cap’n Crumbie?”</p>

<p>“Come hither!” said Jack, catching hold of
George’s ear and leading him upon the sloop.
“Step into the office. Not into the sea, idiot!
Quick march, into the cabin! Now, sit down.
See,” he added, producing a small note-book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
from his pocket; “I have been working out some
figures. We’re making money, son—not millions,
exactly, but we’re doing better than I
ever expected. I want to have a settling up
with you. I asked Cap’n Crumbie what would
be fair, and he said you ought to have a third
of the takings. The boat takes a share, and as
she’s mine, that goes to me, of course. The
other third I take.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to take a share,” George
protested. “I’ve done nothing, except play
around a bit.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether you want to or not;
you’re going to if I have to give it to your
father for you. Think of your starving wife
and children that you were talking about when
I signed you on.”</p>

<p>The captain fetched out a bundle of bills and
a handful of loose silver, laid them on the table,
and divided the money into three piles. One he
pushed over to his mate and the rest he stowed
into his own pocket.</p>

<p>“What’ll I do with all this?” asked George.</p>

<p>“How do I know? Found a college or something.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Anyway, drop it into your pocket now.
By the way, don’t forget to report on Sunday,
in your best uniform, the one with the gold braid
on it that I didn’t buy you. The Farnhams
are coming out for a sail, and I’ll need your
help, Mr. Mate.”</p>

<p>The sloop was tied up each night at Garnett
and Sayer’s wharf, where Cap’n Crumbie could
see her during his nightly peregrinations. Not
that Jack was afraid of her being stolen, for
such a thing was unlikely, but there was always
the possibility of the youthful element of Greenport
scrambling over her and doing damage.</p>

<p>On the morning following Rodney Farnham’s
rescue, however, the watchman reported something
to the captain of the <i>Sea-Lark</i> which
aroused vague misgivings in him.</p>

<p>“What time did you go to bed last night?”
asked the Cap’n, eyeing Jack suspiciously.</p>

<p>“About ten o’clock. Why?”</p>

<p>“Umph!” snorted the watchman. “I
thought maybe it was you prowling around,
having some sort of a joke; and yet I knew it
was too late for you to be up to any pranks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“Not a prank!” replied Jack. “I was tired
and went straight to sleep. You went to bed
early too, didn’t you, George?”</p>

<p>The mate nodded, and the watchman pushed
his cap back and rubbed his head in a perplexed
fashion.</p>

<p>“Blest if I know, exactly,” he said. “The
sloop’s all right. I went on board and examined
her again this morning, and not a thing had
been touched.”</p>

<p>“Examined her <em>again</em>! But what happened
in the night?” Jack was now becoming concerned,
in spite of the fact that the sloop lay
basking in the bright sunshine at his feet.</p>

<p>“’Twas about midnight, as near as I can remember,”
said the Cap’n. “I’d been having a
little doze in my cubby, and I walked out here
to take a squint ’round. I’d no idea anything
was wrong, mind you. It was mighty dark,
’cause the moon hadn’t got up yet, and it was
cloudy. I was standing right here, lighting my
pipe, when I heard something down yonder at
the far side of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>. It wasn’t much
of a noise, more like the soft bumping of a dory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
up against her side than anything. P’r’aps I
wouldn’t have taken any special notice of it,
only there was no wind, and as far as I could
remember nobody had left any dory near.”</p>

<p>“‘Hello, there!’ I calls out, not thinking anything
special about it. If I’d known then what
I knew a minute later I’d ha’ been down aboard
the sloop afore you could ha’ said your own
name. But I didn’t.</p>

<p>“There was somebody there, right on the deck
of your ferry-boat, but he didn’t say a word.
I heard the bumping sound again, as though
he’d drawn a dory to the side with a jerk, and
he jumped into it. Then he rowed off quick as
lightning. I hollered after him, but he took no
notice, so I got my lantern and went aboard the
sloop. The cabin door was locked, just as you
always leave it. Come to think of it, there’s
nothing special any one could steal. Anyway,
that’s all that happened, but you may be sure
I didn’t take no more dozes till daybreak.”</p>

<p>“How queer!” commented Jack, uneasily.</p>

<p>“Rowed clean away, he did. Mind you, it
might ha’ been some one who’d landed there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
while I was dozing, and he was just putting off
again, but why did he land against the side o’
the <i>Sea-Lark</i> when he could pretty near have
walked onto the wharf ten yards further on?”</p>

<p>“And what was he doing there, anyway, at
midnight?” asked Jack. “You don’t get people
prowling around the wharf very often at
that time of night, do you?”</p>

<p>“If I catch ’em at it you may be sure I want
to know what they’re after,” replied the watchman.
“The queer thing about it was his sliding
off without saying a word when I hailed
him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” said Jack. “There may
have been nothing wrong, of course, but, well,
you see, I should feel sick if anything happened
to that boat.”</p>

<p>“I wonder who it could have been,” said
George.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Crumbie, I have half a mind to spend
to-night on board,” said Jack. “I could sleep
in one of the bunks in the cabin just as well as
in bed at home.”</p>

<p>The watchman took his pipe out of his mouth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
and carefully laid it down. When he did that
you knew he was thinking hard.</p>

<p>“There’s no <em>need</em> to do that, son,” he replied,
“so long as I’m here. You may depend
on it I’m going to keep my eyes skinned for the
next week or so, till we get the moon again.
But then again, there wouldn’t be any harm
done if you do want to sleep aboard.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jack, let’s,” pleaded the mate. “I
don’t think I’ve ever slept on a boat.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the skipper. “If we
both get murdered don’t blame me. Bring a
blanket down after supper, George, and we’ll
make ourselves comfortable.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie lent the boys a lantern, and
after wishing them a cheery “good night,” left
them alone. For about an hour they chatted,
and then, feeling sleepy, turned out the light
and rolled themselves up in their blankets.
George dropped off to sleep within a few minutes,
but Jack turned about in his bunk for some
time before following suit. He did not expect
his slumbers to be disturbed, for, the more he
thought about it the more he came to the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
that the visitor to the sloop the previous
night must have come to the wharf for something
which had nothing to do with the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.
There was so little on board that could
be stolen. Nobody in his senses would do such
a clumsy thing as attempt to get away with the
old sails, he mused.</p>

<p>It was pitch-black in the cabin. Up on deck
it was not much better, for the thin crescent of
a moon was not due for hours yet, and there
were clouds in the sky again to-night. Occasionally
the sloop rocked gently as the water
lapped her side and burbled between her and
the wharf. It was a soft, soothing sound.
Jack was perfectly comfortable, and very
happy. It was a good idea to sleep on the boat,
he reflected. The novelty of the thing appealed
to him greatly. Later, when the weather grew
hot, he and George would often do it. He wondered
vaguely what Cap’n Crumbie was doing
on the wharf. Perhaps snatching forty winks
in his own little snuggery. Jack felt he
couldn’t blame the Cap’n if he did snatch forty
winks—fifty, if he liked—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>And then he dropped suddenly into healthy
slumber.</p>

<p>How long he slept he had not the remotest
idea, but he awoke with a start. Something
had happened, but he did not quite realize what.
That he <em>had</em> been awakened by something he
was perfectly sure. Almost holding his breath,
and listening intently for the slightest sound, he
lay perfectly still, his eyes open, but seeing
nothing in the darkness.</p>

<p>After perhaps twenty seconds Jack raised
himself cautiously to his elbow, still straining
his ears. Then there came again the thing
which had awakened him.</p>

<p>The sloop swayed, as though something were
being pressed heavily upon her side.</p>

<p>Silently as a shadow, Jack slipped from his
bunk, and extended a hand to awaken his chum.
But on second thought he changed his mind.
George would be sure to say something if he
were awakened, and that would scare the midnight
prowler off instantly.</p>

<p>Jack was standing in the middle of the cabin,
feeling for a stout stick which he had placed at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
hand before going to sleep. Then there came a
slight creaking sound from the handle of the
companionway door.</p>

<p>Some one outside was turning it.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>THE CLUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jack’s hand closed tightly on the stick and
he raised it, ready to strike.</p>

<p>The door hinges creaked. Jack’s pulse was
thumping as he had never known it to do.
There was, of course, the bare possibility that
this might be the watchman paying them a visit
to see that all was well, and Jack had no desire
to lay the worthy Cap’n Crumbie out on the
cabin floor with a cracked skull.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he asked in a voice which he
hardly recognized as his own. The boy could
not even make out the outline of the intruder in
the blackness.</p>

<p>There was a moment of tense silence, but only
a moment. As soon as the midnight visitor recovered
from the shock of finding some one in
the cabin he closed the door with a bang just as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Jack brought down his stick sharply, but it only
came in contact with the wooden panel.</p>

<p>George leaped out of his bunk in alarm.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” he shouted.</p>

<p>Jack, however, had no time to waste on explanations.
He seized the handle and flung
open the door, just in time to hear the soft patter
of bare feet along the deck, and the deep
bass of Cap’n Crumbie, up on the wharf, whom
the noise had attracted.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack! Are you there? What’s
up?” he called down anxiously.</p>

<p>Jack was by now half-way across the deck,
following the retreating figure, but the mysterious
visitor leaped over the side into a boat and
pushed away before the boy could get within
reach.</p>

<p>“Somebody came into the cabin,” Jack
shouted back to the watchman. “Slip on board,
and we’ll go after him on the sloop.”</p>

<p>“You can’t, son,” replied Cap’n Crumbie.
“There ain’t enough wind. Listen! Which
way did he go?”</p>

<p>The watchman and the two boys strained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
their ears, but the fugitive, after pulling a few
strokes, had evidently dipped his oars in the
water gently. Not a sound was to be heard,
save the swish of the tide against the wharf
piles and the side of the sloop.</p>

<p>“Well, if that don’t beat the Dutch!” exclaimed
Cap’n Crumbie. “You didn’t <em>see</em> him,
o’ course?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Jack. “I was asleep, and we
had no light. If I’d been half a second quicker
I might have winged him with this stick, but I
couldn’t be sure it wasn’t you. He slammed
the door in my face and bolted as soon as I
spoke.”</p>

<p>“I heard you call out,” said the watchman,
“and that fetched me to the side of the wharf
at a run, but I’d heard nothing afore that. I
got a scare at first, ’cause I thought some one
was killing the pair o’ you.”</p>

<p>“Nobody touched either of us, thanks,” said
Jack. “It was queer, though. The fellow
never said a word. In fact, it might have been
a ghost; only I heard the creak of the door-knob
when he turned it, and I could distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
hear him running along the deck. Ghosts don’t
patter about the deck in bare feet, do they,
Cap’n Crumbie?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no ghost,” grunted the watchman.
“It must be the same chap who came aboard her
last night, and ghosts don’t float around in
dories; leastwise I never heard of ’em doing it.
No, it’s something he’s after, but what in
thunder that might be I dunno.”</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness I knew,” said Jack.
“It’s—it’s worse than ghosts. I believe it is
some one who wants to steal the sloop. If they
knew how to handle her they could sail miles
away before morning, and then if they painted
her name out it wouldn’t be easy to trace her.”</p>

<p>“But if some one wants to steal her, why
should he come into the cabin?” asked George.
“He never dreamed there might be some one
on board, and all he had to do was cast off.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the feller just peeped inside to make
sure he wasn’t doin’ any kidnapping,” suggested
the watchman. “He’d ha’ been in a
rare fix if he’d got out to sea and then found
he had the owner aboard with him all the time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“We’re only guessing, anyway,” said Jack.
“And there’s nothing to tell us whether we’re
anywhere near the truth or not. All the same,
I’m glad I slept on board, or I don’t know what
might have happened. And here’s another
thing. I’m going to sleep on board to-morrow
night, too, and every other night, for a while.
You can’t sit on the deck of the sloop all night,
Cap’n Crumbie, and if some one wasn’t right
on the spot every minute I believe this mysterious
chap would get away with her.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to sleep on board, too,” said
George.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the watchman.
“’Tain’t such a bad idea, at that; only you
want to keep your light going all the time. Not
that you’ll catch anybody that way, but you’ll
be safest.”</p>

<p>The lantern in the cabin had now been lighted,
and the boys returned to their bunks, as there
seemed no likelihood of any further excitement
that night.</p>

<p>At dawn the skipper went on deck, and looked
around as though half expecting to find evidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
of the previous night’s encounter.
Everything on the sloop was just as he had left
it the previous afternoon after his last run
across the ferry. Not even—</p>

<p>Suddenly the boy came to a standstill and
stared down, his brows knit. Then he began to
chuckle softly, and returned to the cabin.</p>

<p>“George, ahoy!” he said. “Wake up, lazy,
and come out! I’ve something to show you.”</p>

<p>The mate opened his eyes and stretched.</p>

<p>“What’s up now?” he asked, yawning.</p>

<p>“I want to offer you my compliments,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“Something must be wrong with you, Cap’n.
You’re too polite to me this morning.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s genuine gratitude,” replied the
skipper. “Your father was right when he said
you couldn’t do carpentering-work for nuts.”</p>

<p>“Shoot!” replied George, with an air of suspicion.</p>

<p>“We mended that broken place on the rail together,
didn’t we?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, you sawed the piece and I nailed it
on,” agreed George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. And not knowing better, you left the
sharp end of a nail sticking up. Come and look
at it.”</p>

<p>George hopped out of the bunk and followed
his chum on deck.</p>

<p>A fragment of gray cloth was adhering to the
sharp point.</p>

<p>“It’s our ghost-trap!” said Jack.</p>

<p>The mate knelt down and inspected the thing
curiously.</p>

<p>“This is where he slid over the side, and
tore his coat, or his pants, maybe,” the younger
lad commented sagely. “All the same, I don’t
see how that helps us any.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t, in a way,” agreed Jack. “But
it’s what the detective chaps would call a
clue.”</p>

<p>“What to?” George asked, laughing.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the captain. “A
clue’s a clue, chump! You’ve got to have clues
before you can catch anybody.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see how you can catch a ghost just because
he tore his pants on a nail,” commented
George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>“Now, George Santo, <em>do</em> ghosts wear pants?”</p>

<p>“Not this season,” replied George. “Hullo,
Cap’n Crumbie,” he added, calling to the watchman
who had just appeared on the edge of the
wharf. “Come and see what our ghost left
behind!”</p>

<p>The watchman scrambled down the rough
ladder on one of the piles, and with a judicial
air viewed the fragment of cloth.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he said at length, “that’s just about
where he slid over the side the night afore. But
I reckon we’ve seen the last o’ that customer.”</p>

<p>“You mean you don’t think he’ll come
back?” queried Jack.</p>

<p>The watchman slowly nodded his head.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty poor sort o’ fish that bites at
the bait a second time, after feelin’ the hook,”
he commented. “An’ if I’m any judge, this
isn’t a fish o’ that kind. He’s cute. Nobody’s
seen him. Nobody’s heard him speak.
There’s a hundred million people in the United
States, and so far as you or I know, it might be
any one of ’em. All we got is a bit of his pants
to go by, and if you arrested every man in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Greenport who has met with a little accident o’
that kind, we’d have the jail full. No, Jack,
your fish has got away this time, an’ if he comes
back it won’t be in the same way; you mark
my words.”</p>

<p>“I shall sleep on board, though,” declared
the captain of the sloop.</p>

<p>“Sure thing! That’s the only way to keep
him off. What licks me is, what’s he after?”</p>

<p>“There’s something queer about it all,” commented
Jack, puzzled. “Maybe that’s the last
we shall see of the chap, though.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t see him,” replied Cap’n
Crumbie. “That’s where he’s clever.”</p>

<p>That evening the two boys returned to the
sloop after supper, Jack determined to defend
his own property if necessary, and George
equally determined to stand by his chum. They
took something on board to read, and settled
themselves comfortably. Presently, however,
George threw down his book. Fiction seemed
tame compared with the possibilities around
him.</p>

<p>“I asked Dad to-day if he’d lend us his revolver,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
the mate said. “But he didn’t seem
to fancy the idea.”</p>

<p>“What was he afraid of? That we might
shoot ourselves?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that was it,” replied George.
“He’s afraid one of us might blaze away at
the first person who came on board, and make
an awful mess of the wrong party.”</p>

<p>“That would be awkward, for the wrong
party. After all, I’d rather depend on this
stick. I’d pity any one who got a real crack
from it. I was thinking just now, though,
George, it mightn’t be a bad idea to tell the
police what’s happened.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’d only laugh at us.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, because. We’ve got nothing to tell
them, really. A man came aboard one night
and tore his clothes on a nail. What about it?
They’d tell you nobody could be arrested for
that.”</p>

<p>Jack drummed his fingers thoughtfully on the
top of the table.</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether they laugh or not,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
he said at length. “I’m going to report what
happened. Maybe they can see further through
a brick wall than I can. That’s what they’re
for. I’m going now. Coming up with me?”</p>

<p>George reached for his shoes, and three minutes
later the boys were on their way to the
police station. In the grim and unfamiliar surroundings
of the chief’s office, where the boys
were received, Jack felt a little less sure of
himself.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>“You know the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, the boat I’m using
for the ferry?” Jack asked.</p>

<p>The chief nodded, and tapped a writing-pad
on his desk with the point of a pencil. Though
attentive, he was not much concerned, for other
affairs were pressing.</p>

<p>“Well, some mysterious person has been coming
on board her at night,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“What sort of a person?” asked the chief,
stifling a yawn.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. It was dark, and we
couldn’t see him.”</p>

<p>“Well, what happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Why, nothing, exactly,” replied Jack. “It
was about midnight and I heard some one
prowling about on the deck. He opened the
companionway door into the cabin and I jumped
out of my bunk, ready to hit him with a stick,
but he bolted.”</p>

<p>“Were you attacked?” There was something
extremely matter-of fact about the direct
question.</p>

<p>“I didn’t get hurt, if that is what you mean.”</p>

<p>“But were you attacked? Did this mysterious
person attempt to strike you or anything
like that?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t have time. You see I was ready
for him with the stick when he opened the
door.” Jack was a little discouraged by the
lack of interest which the chief displayed. The
latter seemed to be preoccupied and quite without
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Did this person steal anything?”</p>

<p>“No. There wasn’t much he could have
stolen.”</p>

<p>“Then all it amounts to is this: Somebody
walked across the deck of your sloop in the early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
hours of the morning and opened the door of
the cabin. You haven’t got much of a case for
us to handle, young man.” He smiled, but there
was something rather ironical about that smile.
“Even if we found this midnight visitor of
yours—which I hardly think is likely, as you
don’t know what he looks like, and you don’t
really know whether it’s a man or a woman—what
would you like us to charge him with?
Certainly not theft. And you know as well as
I do that there isn’t anything so very peculiar
about a man walking across the deck of another
man’s boat, whatever the time of day or night.
I’ve done it myself, dozens of times. Sometimes
one has to, to get ashore.”</p>

<p>“But he opened the door of the cabin.”</p>

<p>The chief shrugged.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” he queried. “It may
have been some sailor or fisherman who was
curious to see what it looked like inside. Or,
again, it may have been some one who was looking
for a place to sleep for an hour or two, and
he never dreamed there was any one aboard.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t sound very much, if you look at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
it like that, does it?” Jack said, nonplussed by
the cold and logical attitude of the chief. “But
I thought we ought to come up and let you
know.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied the official. “But
I guess there’s nothing to be alarmed about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot,” said Jack, feeling in his
pocket, “we found a sort of a clue. The man
tore his clothes on a nail as he slipped over the
side, and next morning this was sticking on the
nail.”</p>

<p>The chief examined the scrap of material
gravely for a moment.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder he didn’t come back and kick
up a row with you for leaving nails sticking
up,” he said, handing back the fragment of
cloth. “If I were you I’d say nothing more
about that, or you’ll may be having some one
come and pitch into you.”</p>

<p>Jack bit his lip. Evidently he was wasting
his time here, and the off-hand manner of the
chief gave him no particular reassurance.</p>

<p>“I should be rather pleased if the man who
got on to that nail did come and kick up a row,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
he said. “Then I should know who it was.”</p>

<p>“How would that help you? He’s done nothing
unlawful, as far as I can make out.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he hasn’t really,” Jack was compelled
to admit. “All the same, I’m glad I
came up and told you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, son,” said the chief, rising
from his chair as a signal that the interview was
over. “If anything more happens, though, you
let me know.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Jack, dubiously, turning
toward the door.</p>

<p>“When you come to think of it,” observed
George, as they walked in the direction of the
boat, “we hadn’t an awful lot to complain of,
had we?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” replied Jack.
“It doesn’t sound very serious when you have
to admit that no actual crime has been committed.
I’m not at all satisfied. I was going
to tell the chief about that man Martin, but I
saw it wasn’t any use. My guess is as good as
any one else’s, and my guess is that Martin was
the man who tore something or other on that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
nail. I’ve got no real reason for saying so,
mind you, and perhaps it isn’t fair to Martin
to suspect him, but there isn’t any one else to
suspect.”</p>

<p>“I looked as closely as I could to-day at his
coat and pants,” said George, “in case there
was any sign of a tear.”</p>

<p>“So did I. I didn’t see anything, of course.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What did you notice, though?” Jack asked.
“I mean something that fitted in with the clue?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I could swear he had a different suit
on from the one he generally wears,” Jack declared.
“Unfortunately I hadn’t taken particular
notice before.”</p>

<p>“Now you mention it, I believe that’s right,
too,” agreed George. “But I know what the
police would tell you if you pointed that out.
They’d say a man couldn’t be arrested for
having two suits of clothes. And he couldn’t,
of course, or else both you and I would be in
prison.”</p>

<p>That night Jack decided not to keep the lantern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
burning. As he explained to the mate,
they were not sleeping on board so much for
the purpose of keeping people off the boat, as
to find out who it was who was displaying such
peculiar interest in her. They stayed awake
until rather late, chatting, with occasional
pauses in which they both listened intently when
some trifling sound caught their ears, but toward
twelve o’clock both dropped off to sleep,
and awoke next morning without having been
disturbed.</p>

<p>When the following Sunday came the weather
was perfect, and Tony gave his young apprentices
permission to take Mrs. Farnham and her
family outside the breakwater. They sailed
past Greenport Lighthouse on the tip of the
Point, and manœuvered for an hour or two in
the broad ocean. Mrs. Farnham expressed
herself as delighted with the trip, and Rodney,
who had rarely been in a sailing-craft since his
father had acquired their motor-boat, declared
he was as much in love with the old <i>Sea-Lark</i>
as ever.</p>

<p>“If you like her as much as that,” said Jack,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
jokingly, “you had better sign on as one of my
crew.”</p>

<p>“I would, like a shot, if you’d let me,” replied
Rod.</p>

<p>“Well, if you mean that, report for duty in
the morning. My mate won’t be able to help, as
he has to do something for his father, and I
expect we shall be pretty busy at the ferry.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mind, do you, Mother?” asked
Rod.</p>

<p>“Not if it amuses you,” replied Mrs. Farnham.
“I would rather trust you in the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
than in that canoe of yours, any time.”</p>

<p>And in this way Rodney Farnham was unofficially
“signed on.” The more Jack knew the
city lad the more he liked him. They were
about the same age, and had very similar tastes,
and they became excellent companions, despite
the fact that one was working hard through the
vacation to help his father, and the other attended
an expensive New York school and could
have spent most of his time, had he chosen, in
rolling about in a luxurious limousine. But the
sea had a fascination for Rod. He was never so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
happy as when, dressed in a flannel shirt, more-or-less-white
trousers, and sneakers, he stood on
the swaying deck of the little sloop, jumping to
obey the captain’s orders and feeling the sting
of the fresh salt air on his cheeks. He and
George, also, became chums, and the three boys
spent many a happy hour on the sloop. Their
trips in her, now, were not always limited to
the regular run between Garnett and Sayer’s
wharf and the Point, for Tony considered they
were perfectly capable of sailing out beyond
the breakwater, in favorable weather, so long as
they kept within a mile or so of shore; and
Cap’n Crumbie was not long in arranging for
them to take out occasional pleasure parties.
Sometimes during the evenings and on Sundays
they ran down the coast, almost as far as Mackerel
Point, and at others, when the wind was
more suitable, they chose the direction of Indian
Head, there to run within a mile or two
of the place where the now dancing <i>Sea-Lark</i>
had lain so long in her sandy bed.</p>

<p>Once, when the sloop was gliding under
Indian Head, Jack looked up at its well-remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
outline, and his fancy drifted back to
other days.</p>

<p>“Rod, have you ever been an Injun?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“How do you mean? Played at being one?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In full war-paint and feathers, scalping
the enemy, and hunting buffalo, and taking
hostages, and following the trail of palefaces,
and tomahawking them?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Rod. “I’d have liked it finely,
but we never seemed to get a chance to hunt even
that sort of buffalo in New York. I wish I
had.”</p>

<p>“See that headland?” the skipper queried.
“That’s the place where Sitting Bull and White
Fox made their famous stand, with their backs
to the edge of the cliff. The Iroquois had attacked
them in thousands, and killed all the defenders’
braves. But Sitting Bull and White
Fox outwitted the enemy. They had a trap
laid, and the invaders all fell into a hole, where
they were left to die, and Sitting Bull and White
Fox lived happily ever after.”</p>

<p>“They must have been lonely,” commented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Rod. “I’ve never heard of this bit of history.
What sort of a trap was it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly remember,” replied Jack.
“It must have been about eight years ago.
There’s White Fox sitting on the deck-house
now, laughing at you. Beat him on the head
with a belaying-pin for me, will you, please?
That’s the place where we used to play Injuns
when we were kids.”</p>

<p>More than once, these days, Jack came across
the man named Martin who had asked the captain
to sell the <i>Sea-Lark</i>. He crossed in the
ferry occasionally, apparently going for the sail
only, as he either returned to the town without
going ashore or strolled aimlessly about until
the sloop returned to the Point. Jack’s instinctive
dislike for the fellow deepened, a state
of affairs which was by no means remedied by
Martin’s attempts to get on a friendly footing
with the owner of the sloop. His manner was
difficult to understand. He was impudent, in a
way, and yet he cringed; and it was his cringing
more than his impudence which made him
repellent to Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“Why does that chap hang ’round so much?”
Rod asked one day.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows. He’s a mystery to me,”
replied Jack.</p>

<p>“I’d like a little accident to happen while he
was standing on the edge of the wharf,” observed
Rod, quietly. “If I should happen to
trip and bump into him so that he fell over, he
wouldn’t have quite such a mean smile when
we fished him out.”</p>

<p>“Better not,” replied Jack, reluctantly.
“After all, he isn’t doing any harm, but I wish
he’d find some other wharf to loaf about on.
Sometimes I feel as though he were trying to
hypnotize me as he stands and stares down at
us. The worst of it is you can’t go up to a man
and ask him what in thunder he means by looking
at you, especially when you’re running a
public ferry.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Rod, “but there’s no law in the
world to prevent me from accidentally tripping
up and giving him a ducking. He’d find somewhere
else to stand around after that.”</p>

<p>“Suppose he couldn’t swim! No, I’d love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
to do it, but it’s too risky. Maybe he’s a detective,
for all we know, waiting at the ferry to
catch some one. Leave him alone for the present.
The thing is beginning to get interesting.”</p>

<p>And it grew still more interesting within an
hour or so of that conversation. Jack and the
two boys had just returned from a run over to
the Point with a boat-load of passengers, when
Cap’n Crumbie waved his hand to the skipper,
from the wharf. The lads trooped up together.</p>

<p>“<em>Some</em>thing’s up!” said the watchman, with
a mysterious air, glancing toward two retreating
figures which at that moment disappeared
round the corner into Main Street.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>JACK COUNTS HIS PROFITS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Well, what is it?” asked Jack. “Did
our friend turn out to be a detective
after all and arrest some one?”</p>

<p>“Not so far,” replied the Cap’n. “When he
shows me his badge I’ll believe he’s a cop, but
not otherwise. You wouldn’t think he could
say ‘boo’ to a goose, would you? But he can!
A holy terror, that’s what he is, when he starts,
though he looks as though butter wouldn’t melt
in his mouth.”</p>

<p>“But what happened?” George demanded.</p>

<p>“Pretty near everything, except blue murder!”
replied Cap’n Crumbie. “After you left
he was hanging around here as usual, when another
chap came down to the wharf. I was
standing at the door o’ my cabin and the second
feller didn’t see me. I ran my optics over him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
’cause I see he was a stranger to these parts.
Well, he walked down all peaceful-like, kind o’
strolling, as though he had the whole day to
himself. Martin didn’t see him coming, ’cause
he was leaning up against one of the piles, at
the edge o’ the wharf. Number Two had his
hands in his pockets, and was as happy as a May
morning, till all of a sudden he seemed to recognize
Martin. He whipped his hands out of his
pockets, leaned forward a bit, and said something
in a low voice which sounded to me like
‘Whitey.’ Martin swung round as though he’d
heard a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>“‘Hegan!’ he said to Number Two, looking
mighty surprised. ‘What are you doing here?’</p>

<p>“‘Same thing that you are, I s’pose,’ says
Hegan. ‘Didn’t expect to see me for a while
yet, eh?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, you’re too late,’ says Martin.</p>

<p>“And that started it. What they were talking
about I didn’t understand exactly. All I
could make out was that Hegan didn’t believe
he was too late for something or other, and Martin
got so het up he come near to having a fit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
The things he said to Number Two warn’t
never heard in no chapel, and why Hegan didn’t
punch him is more than I can make out. Hammer
and tongs they went at it, but Hegan didn’t
lose his temper as much as the other chap.
He’d made up his mind about whatever it was,
and didn’t mean to give way.</p>

<p>“All of a sudden, Martin spotted me, and as
quick as a wink he calmed down as meek as a
lamb. He muttered something to the other
feller so low that I couldn’t hear, and next thing
you know Number Two produces a cigar-case
and they both lights up and walks away as nice
and calm as if nothing had ever happened.
They hadn’t got off the wharf when you
landed.”</p>

<p>“Mysteriouser and mysteriouser!” commented
Jack. “I’ve got a feeling that something
is going to happen to some one, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Captain Brains, of the good ship <i>Sea-Lark</i>!”
the mate observed, grinning.</p>

<p>“But, joking aside,” said Rod, “there does
seem to be something in the wind, doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
there? What do you think of it, Mr.
Crumbie?”</p>

<p>“<em>Cap’n</em> Crumbie, at your service,” the watchman
corrected, with a reproving glance.</p>

<p>“My mistake, <em>Cap’n</em>. But you’re the only
one who saw the two quarreling. You don’t
agree with Jack that this Martin may be a detective
looking for some one? The other chap,
Hegan, may be another detective, and they’re
both after the same person. That would explain
what you overheard.”</p>

<p>“Son,” the watchman replied, “I’ve been a
law-abidin’ citizen all my life, and the police
haven’t been much in my line. But I’ve got
two eyes in my head, and I’ve never seen a
police officer yet, in uniform or out of it, who
hadn’t got his business written all over him.
No, if either of ’em has ever seen a badge, it
was only when it had to be shown to ’em!”</p>

<p>“You seem to study human nature a lot,”
said Rod. “Do you remember Mr. Harmon,
who has been staying at our bungalow for the
last ten days?”</p>

<p>“’Course I do,” replied the Cap’n.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
“Hasn’t he been coming to Greenport for the
last ten years? You mean the chap who stood
on this very wharf two days since and talked to
me for over an hour.”</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Harmon,” Rod agreed. “Now,
you’re a fairly good judge of people. What
would you guess he was?”</p>

<p>“Ho! I don’t have to make no guess about
him,” said the watchman, scornfully. “I <em>know</em>.
But then I’ve known him so long, and I couldn’t
go wrong.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is he?” asked Rod.</p>

<p>“Why, an artist, o’ course. You can spot ’em
every time. They don’t seem to know nothing
much outside paint an’ sketching. But he collects
butterflies, too. Showed me one he said
he’d paid fifteen dollars for, and it wasn’t
much bigger than my two thumb-nails, so I
laughed at him.”</p>

<p>“You did!” said Rod, smiling. “Why, Cap’n
Crumbie?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen butterflies that <em>were</em> butterflies, in
my time,” replied the watchman. “Sailors get
chances o’ that kind, you know. What with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
what I’ve seen”—he cast a sidelong glance at
Jack and George, knowing he could not stretch
the bow too far before them—“and heard from
shipmates, I was able to tell him all about the
big butterflies in the South Pacific islands.
Pretty nigh as big as my hat, some of ’em are,
flying all over the place, and to be had for the
catching, without paying any fifteen dollars a
time, either.”</p>

<p>Rod roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“He took it all in, of course?” the boy asked
at last.</p>

<p>“’Course he did. ’Tain’t funny,” protested
the Cap’n, knocking the ashes out of his pipe
with unnecessary violence.</p>

<p>“But it <em>is</em> funny,” replied Rod. “You see,
Mr. Harmon’s hobby is butterflies and he spends
half his time and lots of money traveling around
to places like the South Sea islands after them.”</p>

<p>“Well I’m blest!” commented the watchman,
with an inward twinge at the memory of some
of the wilder statements he had made to Mr.
Harmon. “Didn’t know these artist chaps
ever made lots o’ money like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“That’s funnier still,” replied Rod, with a
broader smile. “He only paints pictures for
fun, on vacations.”</p>

<p>“Now, who’d ha’ thought that!” was Cap’n
Crumbie’s pensive reply.</p>

<p>During the next forenoon, Jack in view of
what the watchman had told them, was not surprised
to see the man who called himself Martin
appear on the dock with a companion. And
from the mysterious and yet eloquent signs
which Cap’n Crumbie made, both with his index-finger
and with his left eye, the lid of which
drooped in an unmistakable wink, Jack realized
that the individual with him was his opponent
of the previous day.</p>

<p>Hegan was no more like the popular idea of a
detective than his companion. He was a short,
bull-necked person, with red, beefy hands, a
bold, determined, and also unshaven face, an
insolent air, and bright, beady eyes which darted
about restlessly. He smoked cigars incessantly,
lighting one from the stub of another.</p>

<p>The two men were waiting at the end of the
wharf when the ferry returned from the Point,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
and stepped on board as soon as the other passengers
had disembarked.</p>

<p>“Well, how’s business?” Martin asked, addressing
Jack the moment he got on board. He
spoke in a tone which Jack regarded as a shade
too free and easy, considering the length of time
they had known each other.</p>

<p>“Very good, thanks,” he replied quietly.</p>

<p>“How much is the fare?” asked Hegan, pulling
a handful of coins out of his pocket. “Ten
cents? Here’s fifty for you.”</p>

<p>Jack accepted the half-dollar, and handed back
the change.</p>

<p>“Only ten cents a head,” he said. “If you
want to go for a sail in the harbor you can pay
more, of course.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” declared Hegan.
“What d’you say, Martin? A little run round
the bay, huh? You won’t be seasick? Go to
it, son,” he added, addressing the captain.
“We’ll have a full dollar’s worth.”</p>

<p>And as the <i>Sea-Lark</i> sped away, Cap’n Crumbie,
standing on the edge of the wharf, with his
hands jammed down into his pockets, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
eyes on the little craft slipping into the distance,
shook his head slowly and soberly.</p>

<p>“Now, I wonder where I’ve seen that chap
Hegan afore,” he muttered. “Maybe it was a
long time ago, and maybe it wasn’t such a long
time. <em>But I’ve seen him afore, somewhere.</em>”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with exaggerated friendliness,
Hegan was endeavoring to gain a friendly footing
with the crew of the sloop.</p>

<p>“Nothing like a sail on the briny for your
health,” he declared. “My friend Martin
talked about buying a boat some time since, but
he’s changed his mind now. Says he might be
going back to New York before long, and he
couldn’t take it along with him. I’d like to see
him trying to navigate a sloop o’ this size up
Broadway. Ha, ha! Well, well, you boys certainly
are three good sailors! And a very nice
boat you have here, too. We must come for a
sail in her again. We’ve nothing to do just
now—on a vacation, you know. This boat must
be thirty feet long. A good broad beam, too.
And I’ll bet she has a nice little cabin. Come
down and have a peek below deck, Martin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>Jack, at the wheel, watched them descend the
companion and enter the cabin, where they remained
only a few moments. He heard them
conversing in low tones and though he could not
have explained it, he felt relieved when they
reappeared on deck. It seemed to him, however,
that an indefinable change had come over
the two passengers in that short interval.
Hegan was, if anything, a shade more affable,
and, slapping his thigh heartily,
laughed boisterously at every little joke he
made.</p>

<p>“They’re a queer couple, aren’t they?” commented
Jack, when the men had gone ashore
again at the wharf.</p>

<p>Rod was sitting on the top of the deck-house,
with his eyes narrowed as he watched their late
passengers walk away.</p>

<p>“I give it up,” he said. “It’s none of our
business what they’re after, of course, and
they’re too deep for me.” He paused for a
moment, with his head held on one side reflectively.
Then: “Jack, I can’t help wondering
whether one of those chaps knows anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
about that person who was prowling about the
sloop at midnight.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded and looked up into the clear blue
sky, as though seeking inspiration.</p>

<p>“I have wondered that myself,” he said.
“But what’s the use of wondering? As Cap’n
Crumbie says, there are a hundred million people
in the United States, and it might have been
any one of them.”</p>

<p>During the first few weeks while the ferry was
running Jack had purposely avoided giving his
father exact figures of what the <i>Sea-Lark</i> had
earned, as he wished to save up a pleasant surprise
for him. More than once Mr. Holden had
made inquiries on the subject, expressing the
hope that his son was not being disappointed.</p>

<p>“You’re looking better for it, anyway, my
lad,” he declared one evening while they were
sitting together on the porch of the cottage.
“Not that you were sick, but a month out in the
sea air all day makes a difference to any one.
If you don’t gain any more than that we shan’t
have anything to grumble at, shall we?”</p>

<p>“N-no,” replied Jack. “But you’d rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
the sloop and I fetched a dollar or two in,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“You know well enough I’d be thankful,
Jack. We can do with all that comes our way
these days. Not that I’d have you spend it,
though. If you do get a little in hand this season
I want you to put it away in the bank and
keep it there safely till we absolutely can’t do
without it. By the way, you ought to get those
sails and halyards paid for. Debts are no good
to any one. Promise me you’ll pay for them
as soon as you take enough money to meet the
bill.”</p>

<p>Jack smiled.</p>

<p>“I settled up for those long ago,” he replied,
entering the house and going over to a
cupboard where he usually kept his own particular
property. Taking out a small wooden
box, he returned to the porch, placing it in an
empty chair by his father’s side.</p>

<p>“What have you got there?” Mr. Holden
asked.</p>

<p>“The family treasure-chest,” replied his son.
“It isn’t awfully full, of course, but I intended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
to reach a certain sum before I handed any of
it over to you. Guess how much there is.”</p>

<p>“Five dollars,” said Mr. Holden, immediately.</p>

<p>“What, Dad? Do you think I’ve been running
that packet of mine for over a month and
only made as much as that? Spread this paper
on your knees and I’ll tip it all out so that you
can count for yourself.”</p>

<p>Jack opened the box and upset the contents of
the box on his father’s lap. There were clean
bills and dirty bills, dimes, nickels, quarters,
and half dollars. Mr. Holden raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Why, son, you’ve got a good little pile
here!” he declared.</p>

<p>It was not without a certain sense of pride
that Jack watched his father adding up the contents
of his treasure-chest. For it was almost
the first money he had ever earned, and every
dime there represented one passenger carried
across the ferry, to say nothing of the dimes he
had handed over to his mate.</p>

<p>“Thirty-two dollars!” declared Mr. Holden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
at last. “Jack, you’re a wizard! How did
you do it?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you think I should do as well as
that?” the boy asked.</p>

<p>“Why, no, not in this short while,” replied
Mr. Holden. “Not after you’d paid for your
paint and your fittings, and paid your crew,
too.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are two more months yet, Dad,”
said Jack, hopefully, “and I ought to do even
better during the rest of the season. You see,
the people over on the Point are beginning to
depend on the ferry. We always run on time,
once an hour, and only miss the trip when the
weather makes it impossible. The more the
people learn to look for us, the better it is for
the treasure-chest.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to look to my laurels,” said Mr.
Holden, “or you’ll be making more than I do.
Now, don’t keep this in the house. Take it
down to the bank, where it will be safe. You—you
know, I’ve never felt too safe with money
lying round since—that night—”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden’s voice trailed into silence, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
his sentence unfinished, but Jack knew what
night he was thinking of, and he answered
soberly: “All right, Dad.”</p>

<p>He gathered up the bills and coins and replaced
them in the wooden box. “I’ll keep it
all together till the end of the season, and then
I’ll hand it over to you.”</p>

<p>The throb of an automobile caught the lad’s
ear, and he looked down the street. A large
limousine was approaching the cottage.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the Farnhams’ car,” he said,
going to the end of the porch. A moment later
the vehicle stopped in front of the cottage, and
Rodney jumped out.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought some one to see you,” he
called. Jack needed no second glance to know
that the prosperous-looking gentleman who followed
on the heels of Rodney was the lad’s
father.</p>

<p>“So you’re the young captain of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>,
are you?” asked Mr. Farnham, pleasantly.
“I hadn’t been at home an hour before
Rod insisted on my driving over to see you.
And this is your father? Glad to meet you, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Holden. Your boy has made a real business enterprise
of it, I understand. Well,” he added,
turning to Jack, “and how do you like the
sloop?”</p>

<p>“She’s just perfect, sir, thanks,” replied
Jack, a little shyly. “I—I’m awfully obliged
to you for letting me have her.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Mr. Farnham.
“Don’t forget your promise to take me for a
sail in her sometime.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, she is yours to use whenever
you like, sir,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“She’s not mine, at all!” replied the man,
laughing. “You’re the only one who has any
claim on her now. Besides, I have the motor-boat.
All the same, I’m coming down some day
soon for that sail. I want to see how you and
your merry men manage her.”</p>

<small>THE SEA-LARK TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jack was whistling cheerfully as he cleaned
out his boat. As the sloop’s regular berth
was occupied by one of Garnett and Sayer’s
schooners, which was taking in ice for a trip,
Jack had tied up across the slip to one of Simon
Barker’s boats. He looked round with a start
when a gruff voice hailed him from the wharf,
and saw Simon Barker himself glaring down
from the string-piece.</p>

<p>“Get out of that!” Mr. Barker ordered
gruffly.</p>

<p>The boy, puzzled for a moment, as he was
doing no harm, looked back in frank astonishment.</p>

<p>“D’ye hear me? Get out of that!” the ship-owner
repeated, more truculently. “What
d’ye mean by rubbing the paint off my boat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>Silently Jack cast off, and let the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
swing back across the slip.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me catch you over here again!”
bellowed Mr. Barker, as he made his way back
toward his office at the head of the wharf.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that,” muttered
Jack, smarting, as he fended the sloop from a
spile and tossed her line over it. “You
wouldn’t have found me there then if I’d realized
where I was.” He looked disgustedly
after the ship-owner, whose back was disappearing
through a doorway. “I wouldn’t tie up to
one of your old tubs if it were the only thing
afloat, you old skinflint!”</p>

<p>But in that Jack was mistaken, as events
soon proved.</p>

<p>Two days later there came a blustery, rainy
day—the sort of weather known to the down-east
fishermen as a “smoky so’easter.” For a
brief spell summer was in a grumpy mood.
Drizzle fell constantly, and sharp gusts of wind
swept at intervals across the harbor. Jack,
having made one profitless run across to the
Point, was wondering whether or not there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
any chance of the sun taking another peep at
Greenport that day. He hoped that for once
Cap’n Crumbie was wrong in his assertion that
it was going to last till nightfall. George was
not on board that morning, as it was one of the
days when his father needed assistance, but
Rodney had joined the sloop, in no wise discouraged
by the weather. Both boys were enveloped
in oilskins.</p>

<p>While the <i>Sea-Lark</i> was lying at her berth
Cap’n Crumbie strolled to the edge of the
wharf, casting a glance far out to sea for some
sign of a break.</p>

<p>“There’s a schooner in trouble down near
Four Fathom Shoal,” he announced.
“They’ve just telephoned from the Light about
her.”</p>

<p>“A Greenport schooner?” Jack asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” replied the watchman. “The
light-keeper said he could only just make her
out in the haze.”</p>

<p>“Is she ashore on the shoal?”</p>

<p>“Don’t seem to be. As far as he can see,
she’s a bit to the south o’ the shoal, but she’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
had her sticks blown out of her, or something.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen the tug go off,” observed
Jack.</p>

<p>“She ain’t here, but Barker’s on the job, all
right. He’s scared stiff lest the schooner is one
o’ his boats. Shouldn’t wonder if she is. The
<i>Grace and Ella</i> ought to ha’ got in last night,
but she didn’t.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Grace and Ella</i>!” repeated Jack. The
name had a peculiar significance for him. That
was the schooner which his own father had
owned in partnership with Simon Barker when
the robbery had led to the severing of their business
relations.</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t the <i>Grace and Ella</i>,” said
the boy anxiously. “Somehow—I don’t know—well,
she isn’t in the family now, of course,
but all the same I hate the idea of anything
happening to her.”</p>

<p>“So does Barker!” grinned the watchman,
whose sympathies lay more with the men on the
schooner than with the owner’s pocket. “His
tug went up to Rockmore this morning with a
tow, and he’s hanging on to the telephone and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
nearly having a fit, trying to get hold o’ Burke,
the cap’n.”</p>

<p>“Rockmore is a tidy distance off,” commented
Jack. “Anything might happen to the
schooner by the time the tug reaches her from
there. But the schooner isn’t ashore, you
say?”</p>

<p>“Not as far as the light-keeper could make
out. And the tide is making the other way, so
she’ll be all right for a while, so long as she
ain’t leaking bad.”</p>

<p>Jack looked up sideways at the gloomy sky.
Though the wind was coming in puffs, it by no
means had the force of a gale.</p>

<p>“What do you say to a run out there, Rod?”
he asked suddenly, turning to his friend.</p>

<p>“Out where? To Four Fathom Shoal?”
His face lighted up at the prospect of such an
adventure. “I’m game, if you are.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Jack. “I don’t know that
we could do much when we got there, but the
sloop can make it easily enough, and you never
know! They might be jolly glad to let us bring
them ashore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t saying you wouldn’t get there
safe,” observed Cap’n Crumbie, “though you’d
have to tack all the way against this so’easter.
But the tug may get there afore you can.”</p>

<p>“According to you, though, the tug hasn’t
started from Rockmore yet,” protested Jack.
“There isn’t a soul wants to go across the ferry
at present, so why shouldn’t we make the run?”</p>

<p>“Go to it!” said the watchman. “Nobody’s
stopping you.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Rod,” said Jack, suiting the action
to the word and a few moments later the sloop
was standing straight down the harbor, past
Gull Island, past the end of the breakwater,
out into the open. Jack found the sea was
rougher than he had anticipated when they
came abreast of Greenport Light, but the wind
was nothing to cause alarm. The <i>Sea-Lark</i>
danced and cavorted, heeling well over as she
raced up one side of a green sea and dived down
the other. The water boiled in her wake, for
Jack was carrying every stitch of canvas he
could spread to the breeze.</p>

<p><em>Thump-thumpety-thump!</em> went the curling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
crests of waves as they slapped her bow. Always
she rose before the onrushing swirl like a
bird in fact as well as in name, but sometimes
the crest curled a little higher, swished up at
her prow, and shot over the deck, drenching
everything on board. Several times her cockpit
was awash, and some of the water went down
the companionway into the cabin, but the rest
gushed back through the scuppers into the sea.</p>

<p>“This rain must have got worse since the
light-keeper telephoned,” Jack said when they
had run a mile south of the breakwater and he
was thinking of swinging over on to the other
tack. “The shoal is four miles away from the
Point, and you can’t make anything out more
than half a mile away now. It may let up again
soon, though. Keep your eyes skinned, Rod.”</p>

<p>Jack came about as soon as he had room to
run clear of the Point’s eastern shore. The
loom of the shore was hazy, and as soon as he
went about once more and bore away almost
due south the mist swallowed up the coast-line
entirely. The wind sang shrilly in the rigging
and the boys’ faces smarted with the salt spume<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
which whipped their cheeks and at times half
blinded them.</p>

<p>“Want to go back?” Jack shouted to his
chum, jokingly, when the <i>Sea-Lark</i> in a particularly
playful moment had kicked up her heels
and dived with somewhat alarming suddenness
down a steep green mountain-side, fetching up
at the bottom with a splash and burying her
nose.</p>

<p>“Not likely,” replied Rod, reveling in the
spice of danger which flavored the adventure.
“It’s just beginning to be interesting.”</p>

<p>“She’ll fairly skate home straight before this
wind,” replied Jack, laughingly. “Here comes
a whopper! Look out! Isn’t she a daisy?
See the way she rose to it? We must be about
half-way out to the Four Fathom bell-buoy now.
I thought I heard it ringing just then.
Listen!”</p>

<p><em>Ding-ding-ading!</em> The sound was faintly
audible.</p>

<p>“It’s safe enough to keep on till we work
our way to that buoy,” said Rod. “Dad and I
have been as far as that several times in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
motor-boat, but of course only in fine weather.”</p>

<p>“I know the shallow water is all to the north
of that buoy,” replied Jack. “What I’m worrying
about now is, where is the schooner?
There doesn’t seem to be any sign of her.
Maybe she’s close up to the shoal.”</p>

<p>For another twenty minutes the sloop ran on,
tacking occasionally, and ever approaching
nearer the sound of the bell-buoy, the melancholy
note of which now came clearly enough
across the water.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Rod, suddenly.</p>

<p><em>Swish!</em> came the waves against the prow of
the sloop. Overhead there was the constant
song of the wind in the halyards. The only
other thing Jack could hear for a while was the
bell-buoy.</p>

<p>“What was it?” he asked after a while.</p>

<p>Just then a gust of wind brought across the
water the squawk of a boat’s fog-horn.</p>

<p><em>Conch-conch!</em></p>

<p>“There she goes! That’s the schooner, all
right,” cried Jack, swinging the wheel over and
heading in the direction of the sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p><em>Conch-conch!</em> It was more distinct now, the
wind bringing it directly toward them.</p>

<p>“The tug hasn’t arrived, evidently,” Jack
shouted to his companion. “Didn’t I see something
away across there just now?” he added,
pointing over to the starboard bow and peering
into the haze.</p>

<p>“Yes, there she is!” he cried a few moments
later, as a vague blur became visible through
the rain. “And she’s the <i>Grace and Ella</i>, too.
But what’s happened to her? There isn’t a
spar standing!”</p>

<p>Another five-minutes’ manœuvering brought
the <i>Sea-Lark</i> within hail of the distressed vessel,
and soon she was under her lee.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, Captain Jordan!” Jack called. “The
tug is coming off for you.”</p>

<p>“Hello, youngster! Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know. They telephoned up to Rockmore
for her. She’d gone up there with a
tow.”</p>

<p>“Well, if she ain’t quick she won’t be a
powerful lot o’ use to us,” replied Captain Jordan.
“We could drift home in another month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
or two, with this wind. What are you doing out
here? This ain’t your beat with the ferry.”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t know how bad a fix you might
be in,” replied Jack. “We could have carried
you ashore if the schooner had been sinking.
What happened to your masts?”</p>

<p>Only a few yards separated the two craft.
The little boat was rising and falling on each
wave, Jack keeping her clear, headed up into the
wind.</p>

<p>“A squall struck us about four o’clock this
morning and made a clean sweep. The dories
went, and everything, and afore we knew it
the schooner was bumping her bottom out on
the shoal. If the tide hadn’t turned just then
we’d ha’ been all broken up by now.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s nothing I can do for you, is
there?” asked Jack. Apart from the natural
desire to serve those on another craft in trouble,
the boy would have been pleased to be of
service to Captain Jordan, for he had been on
particularly friendly terms with that stalwart
fisherman ever since he himself first began to
potter about the harbor. Indeed, many a time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
he had paddled about in one of the <i>Grace and
Ella’s</i> dories, and despite Mr. Barker’s enmity,
the lad had received more than one invitation
from Captain Jordan to make a trip in the
schooner to the fishing-grounds, though he had
declined to do so, at the desire of his father.</p>

<p>“You say the tug ain’t coming straight out o’
Greenport?” the skipper asked.</p>

<p>“No telling when she will be here,” replied
Jack. “I don’t think she can be long, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to drop my anchor soon as
the tide turns again,” replied the fisherman,
“unless you like to give us a tow. We can’t do
a thing now, except wait. We’ve got a big trip
o’ fish aboard, too, and she sprang a leak when
she hit the sand. We’ve had to keep on pumping.”</p>

<p>“I can tow you, all right,” replied Jack, “if
you’ll pass me a hawser. You won’t move so
very fast, but I can get you there.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’ll be a salvage job, won’t it?”
said Captain Jordan. “You’d better put a
price on it before we start.”</p>

<p>Jack, who had not thought of turning his adventure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
into a business affair up to that moment,
hardly knew what to reply.</p>

<p>“What’s a fair price, Captain?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You’d better settle that with the owners,
after we get ashore.”</p>

<p>Jack laughed outright.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” he replied. “Mr. Barker
and I are not what you’d call particularly good
friends. What’s it worth to you to be taken
into the harbor?”</p>

<p>“If the tug comes along,” replied the captain,
“it won’t cost the owner anything, but
there’s no sign of her yet and if we keep on
drifting the way we’re headed we’re due to
land up on the Big Popple Beach before long.
I’ll take the first tow I can find and I guess I
wouldn’t kick at five hundred dollars for the
job.”</p>

<p>There was a gasp from Rodney. Jack
blinked once or twice, and the smile vanished
from his face. Then:</p>

<p>“Let me have that hawser,” he said in a
businesslike tone. “Only, Captain, if I start
towing you, I want to finish the job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“Glad to have you,” replied Captain Jordan,
who, though he did not say so, was by no means
heartbroken at the idea of running up a bill
against his employer, in the circumstances.
For, like everybody else with whom Simon
Barker had had any dealings, the captain of the
<i>Grace and Ella</i> had been a victim of Barker’s
meanness. Most of the gear on the schooner
was little better than junk. To wring a new
set of sails out of her owner was one of the
hardest tasks in the world. It was just the
same with halyards, spars, and everything else
aboard that needed to be renewed from time to
time after hard wear and tear. Captain Jordan
was convinced that the loss of the two
masts was due to Barker’s stinginess. Twelve
months previously the skipper had pointed out
a defect in the mainmast and suggested that it
would be safer to have the spar replaced, but
Barker would not hear of it. It was that mast
which gave way first when the squall hit them,
and the foremast, unable to bear the additional
strain, followed suit. Barker, therefore, was
only paying for his own niggardliness.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>SALVAGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The task which Jack had undertaken was
not so formidable as it might have been,
for everything was in his favor. The end of
a manila hawser was cast to him. This he
made fast to the quarter-bitts, and then he
headed due east to clear the end of Greenport
breakwater. When once she felt the strain of
the hawser holding her back, the little <i>Sea-Lark</i>
tugged and fretted like a greyhound puppy at
its leash, for she had a dead weight of several
hundred tons dragging at her heels. And for
a few minutes that dead weight almost seemed
to be anchored securely to the bottom of the
ocean. But the steady pull of the sloop presently
began to tell. The schooner moved sluggishly,
reluctantly, but the main point was that
she moved, and before long the <i>Sea-Lark</i> had
enough way on to make a steady three knots an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
hour, for the wind could not have been blowing
from a more satisfactory quarter.</p>

<p>Exciting moments came when a particularly
strong gust swept down on the two craft. With
her boom swung away out, to catch the full
benefit of the wind, the <i>Sea-Lark</i> strained her
slender mast now and again more than Jack
cared to contemplate. There was no “give”
to ease her, with that solid weight dragging
astern. Sometimes, also, a following sea hit
the sloop viciously, breaking over her quarter,
half drenching the boy at her wheel, and pouring
down into the cockpit. Once, after the sloop
had been struck in this manner, Captain Jordan
hailed the <i>Sea-Lark</i> from the deck of the
schooner.</p>

<p>Putting his hand to his ear Jack turned to
listen.</p>

<p>“I’ll send you a man to give a hand if you
like,” the fisherman shouted down the wind.</p>

<p>Jack could not make his own voice heard in
reply, but there was no mistaking the meaning
of the wave of his arm, with which he signaled
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“Not if I know it!” he said emphatically to
his companion. “What do you think, Rod?”</p>

<p>“I should say not! Why, we must be almost
half-way back now. There would be no fun in
it if we let some one else complete the job.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’m worrying about,” observed
Jack. “We’re on the way, all right,
and if nobody interrupts us we shall get there
safely enough. But where is that tug? I can’t
even hear her squeaking.”</p>

<p>“She must have left Rockmore long ago,”
said Rod. “They’d have some difficulty in locating
us while this haze keeps as bad as it is
now, but they’ll find us, sure enough.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what will happen when the tug
does bob up,” Jack said. “If it arrived just
now I don’t think I’d have the cheek to refuse
to give up the tow.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” So far as Rod could see they
were doing perfectly satisfactorily.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Jack with a laugh, “you’ve
got to remember that we aren’t under steam-power,
and they are, for one thing. Also, the
tug is Barker’s boat, and perhaps—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“Rubbish!” declared Rod. “If you take my
advice you’ll hang on as long as the sloop
holds together and as long as you’re doing
what you contracted to do. Didn’t the captain
say he was glad to have you give him a tow?
And didn’t he agree that if you began to tow
you could finish it?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see,” replied Jack. “I’ve got
no complaints at present. Never heard of such
luck!”</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars seems an awful lot
of money for doing a little bit of a thing like
this, though, doesn’t it?” asked Rodney.</p>

<p>“Yes, it sounds a lot to us, but you must remember
that the <i>Grace and Ella</i> is worth thousands
of dollars and has a full catch of ground-fish
under her hatches. It isn’t exactly the
idea of losing the salvage money that makes
me hope the tug will miss us somehow, though,”
he added with a grim smile.</p>

<p>“It’s quite enough reason,” observed Rod.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I want to keep this tow till we get
right into the harbor,” said Jack. “I can’t
very well be in two places at the same time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
but I’d give a month’s earnings at the ferry
to be standing near Mr. Simon Barker and
watch his face when he sees this schooner of his
being towed in by the <i>Sea-Lark</i>. It won’t take
him more than about a minute to realize that
I’m getting a very nice revenge for something
he said to me only a couple of days ago. Slip
up for’ard there, Rod, will you? I believe I
spotted the Point then, and I want to make
sure of my bearings. The haze seems to be
clearing off a bit—”</p>

<p>Then something happened which he had been
dreading. Across the water, from the direction
of Four Fathom bell-buoy, which the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
had now left full three miles astern, came
the sharp, piping call of the tug.</p>

<p>Four short squeaks, a long one, and finally a
short one.</p>

<p>“No mistaking <em>her</em>,” was Rod’s only comment.
Much to Jack’s delight, the captain of
the <i>Grace and Ella</i> did not attempt to signal
back. Such a proceeding would, however, have
been difficult anyway, against the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>“There’s the Point!” suddenly cried Rod
from the bow and a minute later Jack altered
his course a shade, for the weather was clearing
up rapidly and he saw it was necessary to make
a little more southing. At the same time he
glanced back over his shoulder. The squawk
of the tug was now insistent.</p>

<p>“I believe we shall manage it yet,” he said
delightedly. “Another twenty minutes or so
will take us round the end of the breakwater,
and the tug hasn’t spotted us yet.”</p>

<p>But, as he spoke, the rain ceased, and presently
the ocean was visible for miles.</p>

<p>“Here she comes!” Jack cried as his eyes
fell on the distant shape of the fussy little
<i>Simon P. Barker</i>. “Tearing along like a snail!
And I guess her skipper’s roaring mad now
that he can see what happened.”</p>

<p>“Keep going! Keep going!” urged Rod, almost
dancing with delight.</p>

<p>“You bet I’m going to keep going!” replied
Jack, with the light of battle in his eyes.
“He’d bust his boilers in catching up with us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
now, before we’re round the breakwater. Did
you ever hear Steve Burke talk when he’s real
mad, Rod?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember ever even seeing him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will in a while, and it’s no Quaker
meeting he’s coming to, either! He knows
what to expect from Mr. Barker as soon as he
lands ashore, for missing the schooner. Rod,
I’m not going to let go now. Burke wouldn’t
dare to run us down. Of course if Captain
Jordan cuts us adrift, that settles it; but my
guess is that he won’t.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty race, isn’t it!” said Jack, a
moment later. “Two tortoises, and one of
them hobbled! Thank goodness Burke daren’t
drive his old tug any faster, or her rotten engines
would shake themselves to pieces.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the irate skipper of the tug was
protesting loudly with his squeaky siren. The
<i>Simon P. Barker</i> wallowed and rolled nearer
and nearer, but the <i>Sea-Lark</i> was fast approaching
the safe refuge of the harbor. Soon the
tug was only about a thousand yards astern,
but by then Jack was negotiating the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
breakwater, and there only remained the
straight run up the harbor to the wharf. The
tug, however, evidently had no intention of relinquishing
her claim, for she fussed up to the
heels of the sloop and hailed.</p>

<p>“Let go that hawser!” Burke shouted angrily
to Jack.</p>

<p>“Can’t do it. I’m under contract,” replied
Jack, steadily.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bust your contract, and you too,
if you don’t hand me that hawser mighty
quick,” Burke snapped back. His practised
hand was at the wheel, and the tug was now
gliding through the water within a few feet
of the <i>Sea-Lark’s</i> side. Jack, however, did not
give way an inch. He was by no means sure
that Burke would not bump into him and secure
the tow by main force. But the tug’s skipper
knew just a little too much of sea law to carry
his tactics as far as that. At this stage Captain
Jordan put in a word.</p>

<p>“Let the lad alone,” he shouted. “He came
first, and I had to give him the job.”</p>

<p>“And what’s your owner going to say to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
you?” Burke yelled back to the captain of the
schooner.</p>

<p>“He can say what he likes,” returned Captain
Jordan. “I’ve got a word or two to put
into his ear for sending me to sea with rotten
spars, and I’ve a right to arrange for a tow
whenever I think it prudent. Now beat it, or
you’ll be having a smash-up yet, and then
there’ll be <em>real</em> money to pay out.”</p>

<p>With no alternative, Burke sidled away from
the two vessels, muttering savagely, but realizing
that he could put in no just claim to complete
the tow. By that time Gull Island had
been reached, and Jack could make out figures
on the wharves ahead.</p>

<p>“Jordan is a brick for standing up for you
like that,” Rod said.</p>

<p>“I thought he would,” replied Jack. “But,
you know, a bargain is a bargain, and we had
the law on our side, after all.”</p>

<p>“Our friend Burke looked as though he
would like to bite your head off.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t very polite about it, was he?
But you just wait a few minutes till we draw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
up alongside Barker’s wharf. That’s when
the fun will begin.”</p>

<p>They plodded slowly on until Captain Jordan
hailed them from the schooner.</p>

<p>“Stand by to cast that hawser off,” he directed.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” replied Jack. “Rod, lay hold
of that line, and be ready to slack away.”</p>

<p>“Let go!” shouted Captain Jordan at last.</p>

<p>The hawser fell with a splash into the water,
and Jack brought the sloop round into the wind,
leaving the <i>Grace and Ella</i> with enough way on
to sidle to her berth.</p>

<p>An angry face appeared at the edge of the
wharf.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by meddling in my affairs?”
demanded Mr. Barker, scowling down
on the boys.</p>

<p>“Meddling?” said Jack unruffled. “I was
giving her a little tow. Doesn’t she look as
though she needed it? It was quite a salvage
job.”</p>

<p>“Salvage!” Mr. Barker’s surprise and consternation
were ludicrous. “You get no salvage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
out o’ me, young man! No one asked you
to interfere. What do you suppose I sent my
tug out for?”</p>

<p>“Tug didn’t come in time,” put in Captain
Jordan. “I had to engage the sloop to make
sure.”</p>

<p>“You engaged her?” queried Barker in horrified
tones.</p>

<p>“What else could I do?” retorted Captain
Jordan. “The tide would have turned in another
twenty minutes. Maybe you wouldn’t
have minded the schooner being piled up on
the sand, but I minded.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll pay for it,” snarled Barker.
“I won’t. No, sir! Not a red cent! What
did you arrange to pay this—this kid?”</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars, and—”</p>

<p>“Five hundred!” echoed Mr. Barker in
agony.</p>

<p>“Why not? He saved you perhaps ten times
that much.” Captain Jordan was becoming
annoyed at having to bandy words of this order
from ship to wharf.</p>

<p>Simon Barker leaned over and wagged his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
finger in the direction of the captain of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think for one minute,” he spluttered,
“that I’ll ever pay it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” replied Jack, quietly.</p>

<p>There were few patrons for the ferry that
day, and after landing Rodney on the Point
Jack returned to town and hurried home to his
dinner. He reached the house before his father
was through and quickly told his story. Mr.
Holden was neither hopeful nor helpful.</p>

<p>“Don’t have anything to do with the man,”
he begged. “He’ll find some loophole of escape,
and goodness knows there has been unpleasantness
enough already.”</p>

<p>“But, Dad, I <em>earned</em> it!” the boy protested.
“Captain Jordan knows what he is talking
about. I’m going to consult a lawyer. Mr.
Merrill will see the thing is settled fairly.
What’s the use of letting an old skinflint like
Barker cheat me out of the money?”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden made a vague motion with his
hands.</p>

<p>“If you consult Mr. Merrill you’ll have to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
pay him, remember,” he said. “Lawyers only
cost you money in the end.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Jack, “but you know quite
well I should never be able to get that salvage
money without a lawyer’s help. I want your
permission to put the case in his hands, Dad.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mr. Holden reluctantly.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Jack was explaining to
the jovial little lawyer all that had happened.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Barker hates to part with his
cash,” said the man of law. “But I’ll see him
in a day or two when he has calmed down, and
perhaps he will be in a more reasonable frame
of mind then.”</p>

<p>Mr. Merrill had the reputation of being able
to pour oil on troubled waters more effectively
than any other attorney in the county, but for
once his skill in such matters proved ineffective.
Simon Barker was as obstinate as a mule. He
declared he would be sold up and even go to
prison rather than pay five hundred dollars to
Jack Holden.</p>

<p>“But,” said the lawyer, reporting the outcome
of his interview to Jack two days later,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
“he will pay in the end. He can’t help paying.
He can fight, and stand us off for a long time
if he wants to, but sooner or later, Jack, he’s
got to come to terms. So sit tight, my boy, and
let Simon and me do the worrying.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<small>THE STRUGGLE IN THE DARK</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jack was by now becoming accustomed to
sleeping aboard the <i>Sea-Lark</i>. The slight
motion of the sloop as she lay at her moorings,
and the gentle lapping of water against the side
of the craft, instead of keeping him awake,
lulled him to sleep. There was a delightful
novelty, also, in sleeping on his boat, and the
sense of impending danger which, during the
first night or two, had kept his ears straining,
was beginning to vanish. Both he and George
now dropped off to sleep within a few minutes
of the light being extinguished.</p>

<p>There was one night, however, when George
was not able to keep his chum company, as his
father required his assistance very early in the
morning to get a launch into the water on the
top of the tide. Jack, therefore, had to spend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
the night alone. For an hour or so after darkness
came, he chatted with Cap’n Crumbie in
the latter’s cubby on the wharf, and then
climbed down to the sloop with no thought of
impending danger. In the cabin he lighted his
lantern, read the last two chapters of a book,
stuck his head out of the companionway to see
what the weather was like, and then slipped off
his shoes, preparatory to turning in. As he
placed the shoes under the bunk he began to
chuckle.</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary,” he muttered, going over
to a locker and taking from it certain articles,
including a hammer. “But what a joke if—”</p>

<p>He seemed to find considerable amusement in
his thoughts and once or twice his chuckle developed
into a hearty laugh, as for several minutes
he busied himself at an occupation rarely
indulged in by skippers.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, apparently to the hammer,
when the task was finished, “it can’t do any
harm, and it may do some good.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later he was in the strange
world of dreamland, where pirates and redskins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
became entangled inextricably in adventures
more absorbing than any ever found between
the covers of a book.</p>

<p>Up on the wharf Cap’n Crumbie smoked his
pipe in his cubby, and dozed over an old magazine
until his head nodded. For a few minutes
he, too, dropped off to sleep and then, when his
pipe fell on the floor, he sat up with a start. He
stretched his arms, yawned, and arose to pace
nor’east and so’west on his favorite beat.
There was but a faint light, for the moon was
not due for several hours yet, and the sky was
somewhat cloudy. Due south, three miles away,
the red beacon at the sea end of the long breakwater
shone steadily, while, farther east, the
white glare of Greenport Light came at intervals.
Cap’n Crumbie screwed up his eyes as
he peered into the darkness away to the south
for signs of an incoming vessel, but saw nothing,
and presently returned to his comfortable
chair and the magazine. He stuffed more tobacco
into the bowl of his pipe, sent up prodigious
wreaths of smoke, and fixed his spectacles.
For half an hour he browsed over the printed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
pages, and then, it being a warm, close night, his
eyelids drooped once more. Somewhere a bell
clanged. It was one o’clock in the morning, and
all was well. Cap’n Crumbie dozed and his
pipe fell to the floor with a rattle again. But he
did not move. The watchman was in the midst
of forty winks, and they were very sound winks,
too.</p>

<p>The dark form of a dory came skulking along
the wharves. There was something suspicious
in the behavior of its occupant. He dipped his
oars into the water so silently that the splash
could not have been heard more than a few
yards away. He took a couple of furtive
strokes, and then rested, looking over his shoulder,
while the dory drifted slowly along. Another
two strokes. A voice came from the distance.
It was some sailor calling “good night”
to a belated visitor, but the man in the dory
gave a start. Again he peered over his shoulder
in the direction of Garnett and Sayer’s
wharf, now close by, and after assuring himself
that no eye was on him, dipped the oars
cautiously and sidled toward the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
There was no sound when he stepped with his
bare feet over a thwart to fend the dory from
the sloop. This was done with infinite care, and
the small craft lay still. The man ran his fingers
along the rail until they encountered a projecting
nail, and then he nodded silently. With
cat-like movements, he pushed the dory along
to the stern of the sloop, and stood up, ready to
hoist himself aboard. No sound greeted his
ears save the lap of water against the side of
the vessel. At last he tightened his grip on
the rail, pulled his body cautiously over it,
and crouched for an instant at the companionway.
His fingers closed on the door-knob and
with stealthy tread he disappeared into the
cabin.</p>

<p>One step he took in the blackness, and then
something tripped him up. It was a strong
cord stretched across the bottom of the steps, a
foot from the ground. The man had fallen into
a booby trap of the simplest possible kind,
which Jack had set in the event of any unauthorized
callers disturbing his slumbers.</p>

<p>With a startled cry quickly suppressed, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
intruder sprawled forward, clutching wildly,
and measured his length on the floor. As he
fell his head came in violent contact with the
edge of the table.</p>

<p>In a flash Jack was sitting bolt upright, collecting
his wits. Then he remembered the
booby trap, but he did not laugh now. The
thing had evidently done its work.</p>

<p>With a bound he leaped from his berth,
grasped his stick, and landed on the intruder,
who was already scrambling to his knees. It
was now the boy’s turn to stumble, but they
both recovered at the same moment.</p>

<p>Neither could see the other, although not
more than three feet separated them as they
instinctively sprang apart.</p>

<p>“Stand still, or I’ll shoot!” called Jack. At
the same moment he moved toward the door, but
before he could reach it the man was on him
and had borne him to the floor.</p>

<p>Jack struggled frantically, but his opponent
was stronger than he. A hand was thrust over
his mouth and a knee pressed heavily on his
chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>“Keep still, or I’ll crush the life out o’ you!”
a voice hissed.</p>

<p>But Jack had no intention of keeping still in
the circumstances. One of his legs was free,
and with it he kicked out lustily, making as
much noise as possible, but doing no harm to
his assailant.</p>

<p>The hand on Jack’s mouth pressed still more
firmly. Acting on an inspiration, the boy
opened his mouth, and his firm teeth closed on
a finger. There was a sharp cry of pain and
the hand was withdrawn, whereupon Jack instantly
shouted at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>Down came the hand again across his face,
his half-raised head was thrust savagely back
against the floor of the cabin, and Jack was momentarily
dazed.</p>

<p>“Now will you keep still?” the voice demanded
in a hoarse whisper. While one hand
was being held across his mouth, the boy felt
another close remorselessly over his throat.
His left arm was doubled under him, and although
his right hand remained free, he could
do nothing with it save clutch ineffectually at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
the arm of his assailant. The pressure on his
throat was terrible and he could no longer
breathe. Even then, however, he did not cease
to squirm, and his hand encountered the leg of
the cabin table. Desperately he closed his fingers
over this and using the last ounce of his
now fast-dwindling strength, dragged the thing
over.</p>

<p>Exactly what happened the boy could not tell,
but a moment later he found himself mixed up
in a nightmare of table legs and clutching
hands. His mouth and throat were freed, and
he uttered another loud cry for help, but was
immediately silenced by a savage blow on the
head. Those powerful hands gripped him
afresh and he felt his senses going. He was
choking again, and there was a painful buzzing
in his ears. Vaguely, as though it were miles
away, he thought he heard a shout, and then a
ton weight seemed to be lifted from his chest.
His assailant had gone, and Jack could hear
some one shouting distinctly now.</p>

<p>“Hello! hello, there!” It was Cap’n Crumbie,
outside on the wharf. The boy tried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
call back, but for the moment he was too exhausted.
Then the watchman burst into the
cabin.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack! What in thunder’s up?”</p>

<p>“After him, quick!” Jack answered huskily.
“He’s nearly choked me to death!”</p>

<p>“Are you all right, lad?” Cap’n Crumbie
lifted him to his feet.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so, but—” Jack broke off to
scramble out on deck and peer into the darkness.</p>

<p>The sound of oars could be heard not far
away. There was another dory lying near, and
into this the watchman and Jack hustled and
pulled desperately after the retreating craft.
It had a considerable lead, and in the black
shadows of the wharves was not visible at first.
Finally, though, “I can see him now,” Jack
cried. “Pull hard!”</p>

<p>The man in the other dory was evidently not
an expert with the oars, for he was splashing
badly as he urged his boat forward.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him!” said Cap’n Crumbie.
“He can’t get away now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>At that instant the splashing ceased, and
the pursuers began to gain on their quarry
more rapidly. They were overhauling the
dory at top speed. Cap’n Crumbie stopped
rowing.</p>

<p>“Easy there, lad!” he cautioned breathlessly.
“Maybe that feller has a gun, and there’s no
need for us to get shot.”</p>

<p>Only a dozen yards of still water separated
the two craft now, but there was no sound or
movement in the other dory, and the pursuers
were drifting nearer all the time.</p>

<p>“Why—why, it’s empty!” cried Jack, disgustedly,
as the boat became more distinct.</p>

<p>Two or three more strokes brought them
alongside. It was, as the boy had surmised,
without an occupant—just an empty old dory,
floating idly on the water.</p>

<p>“He must have gone over the side and swum
ashore,” said Jack, chagrined. “We should
have had him in another few minutes. Let’s
pull in closer to the wharves and see if there’s
any sign of him there.”</p>

<p>They searched accordingly, but without success.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
Evidently the fugitive had slipped
quietly into the water and escaped.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got his dory, anyway,” said
Cap’n Crumbie. “Let’s go back for her.”</p>

<p>They towed the craft back to Garnett and
Sayer’s wharf, where the watchman lighted a
lantern and examined it.</p>

<p>“Huh! It’s Joe Whalen’s dory,” declared
Cap’n Crumbie. “The old man’s been in bed
with rheumatism for over a week, and he
wouldn’t hurt nobody, anyhow. This chap
that attacked you must have swiped it. And
there ain’t a dog-gone thing in it, neither,
’ceptin’ the oars. Knew too much to leave his
things behind, he did.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I shouldn’t have got off so well
if I hadn’t thought of using a string to trip
him up,” said the boy. “He would have had
me at his mercy in my bunk if I’d been asleep.
Why, what on earth—”</p>

<p>The lad stopped at the entrance of the sloop’s
cabin, the lantern in his hand illuminating the
scene of the struggle. Then he stooped and
picked up something that was lying on the floor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
half covered by the overturned table. It was
beveled like a chisel at one end.</p>

<p>“That yours?” asked the watchman, puzzled.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen it in my life before,” replied
Jack. “It must have been dropped by
that brute.”</p>

<p>He weighed the bar in his hand, and passed it
over to Cap’n Crumbie.</p>

<p>“I admit I was a bit scared,” he said, “being
awakened so suddenly that way and finding a
man under my feet as soon as I jumped out,
but I should have been a good deal more scared
if I’d known he had a thing like that in his
hand!”</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie ran his fingers through his
hair and sat down on the edge of one of the
bunks.</p>

<p>“One good tap on the head with that thing,
my lad, and you’d ha’ stopped running ferry-boats
for all time,” he said. “That bit o’
string saved your life, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” the boy admitted. “I wonder
whether the Chief of Police will believe now
that there’s something wrong or will wait until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
I’m in the hospital before he does anything!”</p>

<p>“Well, beat it up to the station-house now,
and show them that piece of steel. I won’t
leave here till you come back. Whether it’s
you or the sloop this mysterious feller is after,
I don’t know, but it ain’t likely he’ll be around
again to-night; and if he is he won’t get the
sloop so long’s I’m alive.”</p>

<p>Jack slipped his shoes on and walked to the
police station, where he found Sergeant Banks
on night duty.</p>

<p>“What time will the chief be in?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Eight o’clock,” replied the sergeant.
“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>For answer, Jack placed the bar of steel on
the sergeant’s desk.</p>

<p>“Somebody came into the cabin of my boat
just now, while I was asleep, and left that when
he went out.”</p>

<p>The sergeant frowned over the piece of steel
and then eyed the boy.</p>

<p>“That’s a cold-chisel, I take it,” he said
finally. “Where’d you say you found it?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
Jack told his story briefly, ending with:
“This was about half an hour ago, and you
might catch the fellow if you send some of your
men to look for him.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, young man,” replied the sergeant,
pompously. “Let me get this thing
right, and then <em>I</em>’ll decide what action is necessary.
First of all, you were in here the other
day complaining of some one walking across
your deck, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“He came into the cabin that time while my
chum and I were asleep.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all there is to that. He didn’t
hurt you, did he?”</p>

<p>“No, but he tried to strangle me, to-night.
That’s something, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The officer elevated his eyebrows and puffed
out his cheeks. Without a doubt he was incredulous.</p>

<p>“But just now you said he attacked you with
this bar, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I said he evidently meant to attack me
with it,” replied the boy, impatiently. “He
must have dropped it when he fell over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
string. And then when Cap’n Crumbie heard
me shouting, and answered, the man ran off
without it.”</p>

<p>“Then some one besides you saw the fellow,
eh? That might make a difference, if it’s
true.”</p>

<p>“It was too dark for Cap’n Crumbie to see
the man. He only heard me yelling.”</p>

<p>“Well, what happened then?”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Crumbie and I jumped into the dory
and chased the chap. He was in a dory of his
own. We pulled after him as hard as we could,
and I think we should have caught him if he
hadn’t jumped overboard and swum to one of
the wharves.”</p>

<p>“And his dory disappeared too, eh?”</p>

<p>“No. We found it, but it was empty.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s unfortunate,” said the sergeant,
sarcastically. “Seems like you’re the
only person who saw this fellow and you didn’t
rightly see him, either—just heard him.”</p>

<p>“I sort of think I <em>felt</em> him, too,” replied
Jack, warmly. “Look at my throat. Aren’t
the marks of the man’s fingers there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“Ye-es, but I’ve heard of folks having the
nightmare and choking themselves.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, that I just dreamed the
whole thing?” exclaimed the boy. “Gee, that’s
great! Maybe I dreamed that chisel thing
there, too!”</p>

<p>“I don’t <em>say</em> you dreamed. But you might
have. I’ll give the story to the chief when
he comes on in the morning, and—”</p>

<p>“And meanwhile the fellow can go home and
get his wet clothes off and—”</p>

<p>“I’ll pass the word around,” said the sergeant,
“and we’ll keep a lookout, but I want
to tell you that if we find that you’ve been
trying to put any funny business over, it’ll
go hard with you. You’d better come in and
see the chief in the morning and let him hear
your story.”</p>

<p>Jack returned to the wharf and Cap’n Crumbie.</p>

<p>“Well, what did they say?” the watchman
asked.</p>

<p>“I only saw Sergeant Banks, who was on
night duty. He didn’t seem to believe me, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
he’s going to pass the word round among his
men, and I’m to see the chief in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Banks is a barnacle!” declared Cap’n
Crumbie. “<em>I</em>’ll go with you next time, and
we’ll see if we can’t get ’em to take a bit o’
notice.”</p>

<p>There was no more sleep for Jack that night.
The watchman kept him company until dawn,
and the boy went home as usual for an early
breakfast, after which he and Cap’n Crumbie
repaired to the police station.</p>

<p>“’Morning,” greeted the chief. “Glad to
see you, Cap’n. Now, what’s your version of
this business?”</p>

<p>The chief’s manner was much too airy for
Cap’n Crumbie, and he scowled as he advanced
to the desk. He grunted as he thrust his hands
into his pockets and faced the man behind it.</p>

<p>“My version’s the same as his, chief,” he replied.
“I s’pose you’ve got the feller by this
time, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” he said. “We haven’t made
any arrest yet. There isn’t much to go on,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Cap’n. We watched along the wharves last
night, but didn’t see any one.”</p>

<p>“Guess the feller was home and abed before
your men started to look for him,” grunted the
Cap’n. “’Taint likely he’d stand around and
wait to be caught, is it? ’Course, if he hadn’t
been in the water he might, but being sort o’
wet—” Cap’n Crumbie’s labored sarcasm
ended in a derisive snort.</p>

<p>“Come, now, Crumbie, let’s get this thing
straight. I understand that you didn’t actually
see the man. That’s so, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so, but—”</p>

<p>“But you’re sure there was somebody there,
are you?”</p>

<p>“Sure? ’Course I’m sure! Didn’t I nearly
pull my arms off going after him in the dory?”</p>

<p>“H-m, yes, I dare say. Well, I’ll put a man
on the wharf for the next few nights and maybe
we’ll catch the fellow at it again. How’ll
that do?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’ll help,” admitted the Cap’n,
more calmly. “But, all the same, it ain’t much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
use locking the stable door when the cat’s out o’
the bag!” And he and Jack departed, taking
what satisfaction they might from their visit.</p>

<p>During the course of the morning Martin and
his friend Hegan came down to the wharf, and
Jack eyed the pair suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Ferry doing good business, huh?” Martin
enquired, cordially.</p>

<p>“Quite, thanks,” replied Jack, with his eyes
glued on a patch on Martin’s trouser leg. He
was sure now that the man had worn a different
suit on the day following the visit of the midnight
intruder on the <i>Sea-Lark</i>. Unfortunately
the scrap of cloth left on the nail was far
too small to serve as conclusive evidence, and
for all Jack could affirm to the contrary the
small patch on Martin’s trousers might have
been there for years.</p>

<small>FIGHTING A GALE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That night a policeman was placed on Garnett
and Sayer’s wharf, in accordance
with the chief’s promise, and when Jack and his
mate turned in, it was with easier minds. Mr.
Holden, after hearing of the attack, endeavored
to dissuade Jack from again sleeping on the
sloop, but the boy pointed out that, with the
regular watchman and a policeman on duty,
there was small likelihood of further molestation.
Mr. Holden at length agreed, and, as
Jack anticipated, they were not disturbed. The
captain awoke soon after four o’clock in the
morning and, going up on deck, saw the watchman
and police officer standing at the edge of
the wharf, yarning.</p>

<p>“Well, you haven’t had any more ghosts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
prowling around, eh?” the policeman laughed
as he caught sight of the lad.</p>

<p>“No, and there aren’t likely to be any if we
keep tabs on them this way,” replied the boy.
“Say, Cap’n Crumbie, I hear that the bluefish
have been biting. Where’s the best place to
get them?”</p>

<p>“You’re liable to get ’em anywheres outside
the breakwater,” the watchman replied. “A
chap came in with a big catch yesterday. He
said he had to go a good ways out, though.
You going fishing?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to,” replied Jack. “And George
wants to. I’ve half a mind to slip out for an
hour or two before it’s time to begin running
the ferry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far,” warned Cap’n Crumbie,
craning his neck as he stared upward at the
sky. “It’s all right at present, but I shouldn’t
be surprised if it came on to blow a mite
harder.”</p>

<p>“There’s no wind now, to speak of,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“Not down here,” replied the watchman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
“But look at them clouds a mile or so up.
’Tain’t blowing hard, even there, but I’m just
telling you to keep your eyes open; see?”</p>

<p>“All right, Cap’n, thanks,” said Jack. Then
he climbed up on the wharf and went off in
search of bait. Ten minutes later he returned
and aroused his chum.</p>

<p>“All hands on deck!” he cried, popping his
head through the companionway door. “Come
on, George. I’ve got the bait. Let’s go get
’em!”</p>

<p>The mate needed no second invitation. In
less than sixty seconds he was hauling on the
mainsail halyards, and soon the sloop was standing
down the harbor, a picture of grace as she
glided through the smooth water. There was a
gentle northwesterly breeze which gave a bare
ripple to the surface and sent the sloop along
like some beautiful lazy bird with the red hue
of dawn staining its wings. Both boys were
looking forward enthusiastically to this treat,
which they had promised themselves for some
time. As soon as they reached the open sea a
hand-line with a good heavy lead was dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
astern, and while Jack stood at the helm George
squatted on the deck, facing the trailing wake,
in which the bait danced sixty feet astern.</p>

<p>“Yell out the second you get a strike, and
I’ll luff,” said Jack, with one eye on the sails
and another on the intent figure of his chum.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” replied George, his face set with
grim determination; for fishing, and especially
bluefishing, was the particular joy of his life.</p>

<p>Straight to the south they ran, for a couple
of miles, without getting a bite. Then Jack
headed in the direction of Four Fathom Shoal,
with similar results. Round came the sloop
once more, the captain taking her over all the
most likely fishing-grounds, and both the lads
were beginning to think that the fish among
which the Greenport man had had such excellent
sport the previous day must be miles away
by now.</p>

<p>“Luff!” George cried unexpectedly, at the top
of his voice, as, with both hands, he steadied
the trailing line.</p>

<p>Up into the wind came the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, shaking
her sails as though indignant at being thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
checked in the midst of her career, and George,
with his teeth clenched, hung on but was unable
to draw in a foot of line.</p>

<p>“What is it? A whale?” Jack exclaimed
with delight, watching the straining line.</p>

<p>“No. A sardine!” replied George, jerkily,
his eyes aflame with excitement. “Get that
boat-hook ready. We’ll need a crane to lift
this fellow out of the water.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry him!” Jack urged as his chum
began impatiently to try to haul in.</p>

<p>Suddenly the line began to slip through
George’s wet hands. The gamy fish had made
a prodigious rush, but its captor soon managed
to check the runaway, and then the real battle
began. Foot by foot the mate drew his prey
toward him, and foot by foot the prey contested
the struggle, until its strength gave out. Then,
for a while, as George brought the line in more
quickly, he half feared the fish must have got
off the hook. He had hauled it within four or
five yards of the sloop when the captive began
to show fight afresh, and made a mad dash
down into the depths. There was less “punch”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
in it now, however, and the final effort did not
last long. Soon its bright silvery belly showed
clearly in the water as George drew it nearer.
Jack leaned over the side with the boat-hook,
ready to hoist it by the gills.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty good size—for a sardine,” he
commented dryly. “Keep that line tight,
chump! There!”</p>

<p>The boat-hook was firmly caught in the fish’s
gills, and with a comical expression of wonderment
the mate saw his prize drawn inboard.</p>

<p>“Why—why, it <em>is</em> a bluefish, I suppose?” he
said, surveying the beautiful creature now flopping
about in the bottom of the cockpit. “I’ve
never seen one quite so big as that.”</p>

<p>“It’s twelve or thirteen pounds of bluefish,
all in one piece,” replied Jack, admiringly.
“They don’t run to that size very often round
about here. You’re a hero! I don’t believe
that when Cap’n Crumbie starts stuffing the
summer visitors with his yarns he ever pretends
to have hauled in a bluefish any larger
than that. Bait up, and have another go.”</p>

<p>But George’s catch had evidently been a solitary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
straggler, or the shoal had gone off the
feed, for though the sloop sailed to and fro for
three quarters of an hour longer, the bait
danced astern unmolested.</p>

<p>“Let’s try for cod,” Jack suggested at
length, when it became apparent that they were
wasting their time. Away went the anchor, in
fifteen fathoms of water, and the lads dangled
hook and line over the side patiently for another
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Codfish isn’t at home, either,” Jack
declared, beginning to wind up his line.
“We’ll try a little farther off. Up with the
mud-hook, George.”</p>

<p>Half a mile farther to the south they again
tried, and not even a sculpin rewarded their
efforts. Jack looked up at the blue sky and
glanced further out to sea.</p>

<p>“We’ll have one more shot at it,” he said.
“The weather is holding good. I’m going to
tempt ’em off Knife Rock.”</p>

<p>Again the sloop glided away from the land.
The buildings on the Point became a blur. The
squat stone lighthouse stuck up less plainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“This is somewhere about the right spot,”
Jack said at length. “If we don’t make a haul
inside half an hour or so, though, we shall have
to go, because it’s a good way from here to the
harbor, and we shall have to beat our way
back.”</p>

<p>Two minutes later he gave a movement of
the wrist, and his face lighted up.</p>

<p>“Bite?” George inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, the right kind, too,” replied the captain.
“I’d be very much surprised if that
wasn’t a—”</p>

<p>Again he gave a deft movement of the wrist,
and then began to draw up the line. A fish
was on, fighting gamely, but, cod-like, its fight
was brief. Jack estimated as he hauled it
aboard that it weighed four pounds.</p>

<p>“It’s a baby compared with your bluefish,”
he admitted, baiting up afresh, “but if we’re
going to get sport like this, I’ll hate to
leave it.”</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterward both boys
hooked fish at the same time, and the prospect
of the eight-o’clock ferry-boat leaving Garnett<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
and Sayer’s wharf promptly on time began to
look less certain. The minutes slipped by
quickly, and several more captures were made.
Then there came a pause. Jack was on the
point of drawing in his line and making ready
for the return run, when a sharp tug drew all
his attention, and during the next quarter of
an hour the fish were biting greedily. So preoccupied
was the captain that he did not notice
at first that the gentle breeze, before which
they had run out from the harbor, had freshened
considerably.</p>

<p>“We’d better call it a day!” he said at
length, reluctantly. “Cap’n Crumbie was right
when he said there was going to be more wind.
Lend a hand here with the anchor, quickly!”</p>

<p>An angry little squall swept over the surface
while the boys were tugging at the cable.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the thing!” Jack
exclaimed, as the anchor refused to come up.</p>

<p>“It’s stuck in the sand,” George said.
“Give it time.”</p>

<p>But, though the lads strained to the utmost,
the anchor refused to budge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“Here’s a nice fix!” said Jack, after a while,
resting from his exertions. “Do you know
what I believe?”</p>

<p>George shook his head dismally.</p>

<p>“I believe we’ve been fishing right over the
place where that schooner went down last winter.
Anyway, the anchor has caught fast on
something, and we sha’n’t see it again till the
ocean runs dry.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do? Cut it adrift?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else to do. Isn’t it a pity! Let’s
have one more good haul first.”</p>

<p>All this time the wind was rapidly gaining
force. The boys spent full twenty minutes, in
all, struggling to release their anchor from the
bottom of the sea, and then the skipper drew
out his knife and hacked the manila rope
through. The end disappeared over the side
with a splash just as a fresh squall burst upon
the sloop.</p>

<p>“Whew! That’s fierce!” exclaimed the elder
boy. “She’ll need to be close-reefed for
the job.”</p>

<p>More precious minutes were wasted while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the reef-points were being tied. By the time
the mainsail could be hauled half a gale was
blowing; and though they were but a few miles
from shore, the sea was rising ominously. The
wind had swung round a little more to the
north, making the task of beating back to Greenport
more difficult. Hoping that he might fall
in with a friendly tow, Jack looked around
anxiously for some fishing-vessel bound on the
same journey, but as luck would have it, there
was nothing in sight. This gave the boy no
serious concern for a while as he bore away on
the starboard tack, heading about northwest toward
the shore, but before long he found the
sloop needed delicate handling to avoid being
capsized in the squalls, which now came in
rapid succession. Even with only two thirds of
her usual spread of canvas, the <i>Sea-Lark</i> listed
over dangerously under the pressure of the
wind, her lee rail often being under water while
her bow was pounded continually by the rising
sea. The worst, however, Jack knew still lay
ahead, for he must soon go about and make a
wide sweep to the northeast, this taking them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
farther out to sea, where a much rougher time
had to be anticipated. He consulted George on
the problem.</p>

<p>“We can either turn ’round and run down
the coast to Penley,” he said, “or we can take
a chance and try to work our way back to the
harbor. What do you think? It’s pretty
rough, and as soon as we find ourselves out
there we shall get a drenching, for certain.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’ll make it,” replied George,
pluckily, though he was wet through with spume
already, and this was his first experience of
such weather out in the open sea. “We don’t
want to funk it now, surely.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think,” replied the captain;
“only if you’d rather, I’m willing to make
for Penley.”</p>

<p>“I’m game to try for Greenport, if you are,”
the younger boy declared.</p>

<p>“All right. Here goes!” And the plunging
sloop swung on the port tack, heading northeast
and out to the open sea. She struggled
along for fifteen minutes or so, but it then became
apparent that all was not going well. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
carry more sail was an impossibility, and the
sloop’s maneuvers were not taking her a foot
nearer harbor against wind and sea. Though
awkward, the position was not alarming, for it
was still possible to swing on the starboard
tack again and reach the lee of the land
away to the southwest of Greenport, where
they would have to remain until the gale
eased.</p>

<p>“It’s no good,” Jack declared. “Guess
it’ll have to be Penley, after all. I’m getting
hungry, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention breakfast to me,” protested
George. “I could eat the side of a house!”</p>

<p>As Jack put the helm over, the canvas flapped
and slashed madly, and then, as the sails bellied,
a terrific gust of wind swept down on the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.
Before Jack had time to ease her up
into the wind again she listed far over, the wind
screaming in her halyards while a smother of
spume weltered over her deck. It seemed that
something must give way under the strain, and
in the midst of the confusion the eye-bolt pulled
out of the mast. Down fell the peak, and to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
alarm Jack found the mainsail out of commission
at the very moment when it was most
needed.</p>

<p>Leaving the wheel to take care of itself—for
the boat was no longer under control—he
sprang forward to help George in the task of
getting the useless sail down and stowing the
jib, and as the sloop fell away into the trough
of the sea, trouble of a very real nature began
to overwhelm her. A solid green wave slapped
the side and slopped inboard, filling the cockpit
and nearly washing both captain and mate
off their feet. Away poured the water through
the scuppers, but, although the companionway
door was closed, much of the sea leaked down
into the cabin, and by the time the lads had
furled the sails their attention was badly
needed at the pump. Jack jumped into the
cockpit and worked away at the crank furiously,
while the sloop drifted along under bare
poles, utterly at the mercy of every wave which
came her way. At times she dug her nose deep
down into the center of a rearing sea and fell
away from it crazily, broaching to, only to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
half swamped by the succeeding wave. Away
were swept all the fish the lads had caught.
Time after time the cockpit was full of water,
and there was nothing Jack could do to prevent
it leaking down into the cabin. So long as the
pump did not choke he hoped to be able to keep
her afloat unless she turned over, but the danger
of the latter was now increasing every minute,
for the gale was gaining strength and the
sloop was drifting farther from the lee of the
land all the time. Before long the breakwater,
the houses on the Point, and even the lighthouse
had dipped below the horizon, and the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
was the center of an angry circle of foam-flecked
water, bounded on every point of the compass
by the sky-line only.</p>

<p>“We’re in for it, for fair, now,” said Jack,
standing by his chum’s side in the little cockpit
and recovering his breath while George took
a hand at the pump. “And there isn’t a
blessed sail in sight. Now see what’s coming,
just to cheer us up a bit.”</p>

<p>The first heavy drops of a pelting storm
splashed down on deck, and soon the boys had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
not only the spray from the sea but also rain
slashing their faces whenever they turned to
windward.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll play at this any longer,”
said George, glancing up at his chum with a
humorous grimace as he toiled away at the
pump. “Let’s go home.”</p>

<p>He did not realize quite as well as Jack did
how serious was their plight. With anchor
gone, sails useless, and a storm driving them
away from shelter, to say nothing of the half-swamped
condition of their vessel, there was a
distinct possibility that neither of them would
ever get home again. Though Jack did not
show it, he was beginning to feel that their
chances were decidedly slender.</p>

<p>“Let me have another go at that pump,” he
said, as the sloop recovered somewhat awkwardly
from the swirl of a white-capped wave.
“Maybe the wind will go down soon, and then
we shall manage somehow, but we’ve got to
keep busy with the pump.” Little though he
liked to think so, he felt sure the sluggish movements
of the <i>Sea-Lark</i> were due to her having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
shipped too much water. His hands were becoming
blistered with the task, and his arms
ached, but there was no alternative to struggling
on. Any moment there might appear the
brown sail of a fishing-vessel, and it was this
thought which buoyed him up even when things
looked blackest. Several hours, however,
drifted on before his restless eyes rested on a
speck on the horizon and a cry of thankfulness
burst from him.</p>

<p>“Oh, gee! there’s a schooner or something!”
he shouted, pointing across the wind-swept
ocean, away to the east. “If she’s bound for
Greenport she will have to cut in close to us
when she tacks.”</p>

<p>Their spirits rose high. The speck in the
distance steadily increased, until the boys felt
certain they must be sighted.</p>

<p>“Just in time, too!” George exclaimed.
“They’ll be getting kind of anxious about us
at home by now, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the boys’ hopes were destroyed.
The far-off schooner went about and
before long was hull down once more. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
came as a terrible disappointment to Jack and
his chum, for there seemed little likelihood
of the gale subsiding before night. And, unpleasant
though their position was in the daytime,
it would be infinitely worse in the darkness.
Though the rain stopped, the force of
the wind did not diminish. Jack’s nerve became
just a trifle shaky for the first time when
he knew that the daylight was actually failing.
The boys were both exhausted with continual
pumping; and though, with such real danger
staring them in the face they gave little thought
to the subject of food, the long fast was beginning
to tell on them. George’s face was haggard,
and the captain would not have allowed
him to take more than an occasional brief trick
at the pump, but there was no alternative to
both lads sharing the work. Their hands were
raw, and every muscle in their bodies seemed to
be crying aloud in protest.</p>

<p>“We’ll stick it as long as we can,” said Jack,
laboring painfully at the pump as darkness enveloped
the stricken sloop. “We’ve drifted
miles and miles away from Greenport by now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
but there’s always a chance, so long as we keep
afloat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the wind is blowing quite so
hard,” replied George, who felt decidedly limp,
and clung to the side of the cockpit while the
other lad worked with waning strength.</p>

<p>“It seems to be easing off a bit,” replied
Jack, encouragingly, though he saw not the remotest
sign of any such thing happening.
“Anyway, I’d rather keep on pumping for the
present than swim, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>The seas were running mountain-high, their
curling crescents frequently falling inboard
with an alarming swish. A great wave, rushing
through the blackness, towered high near
them for an instant, as though contemplating
its prey hungrily. Then it came on, while the
<i>Sea-Lark</i> lay broadside to. There was a roar
of rushing waters. Jack gave a warning cry,
and then both the lads were gasping for breath
under the torrent. A smother of sea and foam
swept about over them, filling the cockpit, and
pouring over the other side of the deck. Jack
felt that this must be the finish.</p>

<small>THE SIMON P. BARKER GOES OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">An hour after the two boys left Garnett
and Sayer’s wharf in the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, to
go fishing, Cap’n Crumbie went into town. It
was, for him, a momentous occasion, for he intended
to have his hair cut. On the way he met
a crony and chatted for twenty minutes. Then,
at the barber’s shop, he had to wait half an
hour for a chair. Also, the Cap’n had a shave,
and when, finally, he might have taken his departure,
he met another crony, and there was
an interminable argument on the question of
fishermen’s wages. So that, by the time the
guardian of Garnett and Sayer’s wharf took it
into his head to stroll back to his accustomed
haunts, a distinct change had taken place in the
weather. The wind was singing in the rigging
of the various craft around the wharves.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
There were low clouds scudding across the sky,
with their hint of a coming storm.</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie thrust his hands into his pockets
as soon as he reached the edge of the wharf,
and cast a professional glance round the harbor,
up at the sky, and far out to sea beyond
Gull Island.</p>

<p>“I thought this was coming!” he muttered.
“Ain’t that corn on my foot been aching cruel
enough?” Cap’n Crumbie never breathed to a
living soul the source of his remarkable weather
prophecies, but that corn had served him faithfully,
if irritatingly, for years.</p>

<p>Suddenly he spun around and shot a glance
across in the direction of the Point, remembering
that the <i>Sea-Lark</i> had gone out beyond the
breakwater. He was wondering whether or not
she had returned.</p>

<p>“By Jiminy, they’re out yet!” he spluttered,
showing distinct signs of perturbation, and
screwing up his weather-beaten face as he
peered out beyond Gull Island. He could see
nothing of the little sloop, however, and took
several sharp turns, first nor’east and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
so’west, on his regular beat. But his movements
were not so slow and measured as usual.
There was agitation written all over him.
Each time he turned he gazed out to sea afresh,
and each time, seeing nothing of the sloop, he
grunted.</p>

<p>“By Jiminy!” he exclaimed again, after a
while; and then, as a sharp gust of wind almost
lifted his cap off his head, “By <em>Jiminy</em>!”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Cap’n Crumbie was very
seriously upset. He had every faith in the
lads’ ability to handle their craft, even if something
more than a capful of wind came along,
provided it was not too squally. But there was
the distinct promise, now, of something more
than mere squalls. And if Jack was far out he
would have a hard fight to beat his way back
against this wind.</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie stumped his way to and fro
for another five minutes and then, snorting impatiently,
walked along the wharf to Messrs.
Garnett and Sayer’s office. There he picked up
the telephone receiver and spoke to the man on
duty at the light on the Point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“This is Cap’n Crumbie,” he said. “Who’s
that?... Joe? ’Morning, Joe.... I just
rung you up to ask if you can see anything o’
the ferry-boat. Them two kids went out fishing
in her early.... Saw them go, eh? Well,
ain’t they on their way back?” There was a
pause, while the watchman listened irritably to
the voice over the wire. Then, “All right, Joe.
Ring us up at the office, will you, as soon as you
sight ’em?”</p>

<p>The man at the light had reported that there
was nothing afloat as far as he could see. With
growing impatience the watchman returned to
the end of the wharf, where he now found Martin
and Hegan.</p>

<p>“I don’t see the sloop around,” observed
Hegan, casually.</p>

<p>“No, an’, dog-gone it, maybe you never will!”
snapped Cap’n Crumbie. “It’s miles away,
out to sea,” he went on, waving his arm vaguely
over toward the ocean. “If those two kids
don’t get drownded it’ll be a wonder.”</p>

<p>“They’re in the sloop?” asked Martin, with
peculiar concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, fishing, and been blown to anywhere
by now.”</p>

<p>Then he stopped suddenly, his eyes having
alighted on the tug <i>Simon P. Barker</i>, which lay
alongside the adjoining wharf, with smoke
emerging from her stack. The <i>Simon P.
Barker</i> was the only tug in Greenport. Cap’n
Crumbie cordially disliked Mr. Barker. In
fact, he would have done almost anything in
the wide world rather than ask Mr. Barker to
do him a favor. But personal likes and dislikes
had to be sunk, in such an emergency as this.
The watchman stood, running his hand through
his stubbly beard for a minute, and then
stumped off toward the little office.</p>

<p>“Well!” the ship-owner demanded, looking
up as Cap’n Crumbie entered. He was not in
a particularly pleasant frame of mind this
morning.</p>

<p>“Guess young Holden and the other lad must
be in trouble,” said the Cap’n gruffly.
“They’ve gone out fishing, and maybe they’ll
have difficulty getting back.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about it?” asked the ship-owner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“The tug ain’t doing anything. Can’t you
send it out after ’em?”</p>

<p>Mr. Barker put down the pen with which he
had been writing, and stared at the watchman
in frank astonishment.</p>

<p>“Say, what d’you take me for? A nursemaid?”
he demanded when the power of speech
returned.</p>

<p>Cap’n Crumbie swallowed his anger, swallowed
his pride, and swallowed his desire to
tell Barker just what he did take him for.</p>

<p>“P’raps you haven’t noticed,” said the
watchman, “there’s quite a bit of a gale coming
up. You don’t want them two lads—”</p>

<p>“Get out of here! I’m busy,” snapped Mr.
Barker, rudely. And Cap’n Crumbie had no
choice but to retire. His face, however, was
full of wrath. He could have taken the ship-owner
in his gnarled hands and half shaken
the life out of him; only that would not have
helped matters any.</p>

<p>“Ain’t there some way of sending off help
to those kids?” Martin asked when the watchman
returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, there would be,” retorted Cap’n
Crumbie, boiling over with rage, “if some people
had as much feelin’ as a cockroach. That
man Barker—” He shook his fist at the little
office in which the ship-owner was writing.</p>

<p>“What’s Barker got to do with it?” Hegan
asked.</p>

<p>“That’s his tug,” said the Cap’n, bitterly.
“I just been across and told him about the
sloop, and he’s too dratted mean to send her
out.”</p>

<p>Martin and Hegan exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“But surely we ain’t going to let the poor
lads <em>drown</em>!” Hegan protested.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe they won’t drown,” the watchman
replied. “I guess if it got much worse the
old skinflint would send the tug off, but it’s
rough enough out there now. ’Twouldn’t
surprise me to hear they’d capsized the
sloop.”</p>

<p>Hegan was biting his thumb reflectively.</p>

<p>“What does Barker charge to fetch a
schooner in when there ain’t enough wind for
her?” he asked at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, about twenty-five dollars,” answered
the watchman.</p>

<p>“Well, couldn’t we raise twenty-five dollars
somehow?” Hegan asked. “I’ll chip in, and
glad to. Martin will, too, huh?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” replied Martin.</p>

<p>Just as Cap’n Crumbie stuffed his hand into
a breast pocket and fetched out one or two small
bills, Tony Santo appeared on the wharf.</p>

<p>“Where’s that boy of mine, Cap’n?” he
called out as he approached. “He never came
home for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“You’re the very man I want,” said the
Cap’n, brightening. “We’ve got to get that
tug out, quick. The lads went fishing hours
ago, and I guess they can’t get back against this
wind. I went to ask Barker about it just now,
and he as good as told me to go and hang
myself.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Tony, astonished.</p>

<p>“Because he ain’t giving nothing away, if he
can help it. It’s money he’s after, every time
and all the time. We were just getting up a
subscription.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Tony, in a
businesslike manner. “I’ll hire the tug.”</p>

<p>Two minutes later Tony was in the ship-owner’s
office, demanding that the <i>Simon P.
Barker</i> should put to sea without any delay,
in search of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s all very well you talking to me like
that,” said Mr. Barker, “but you must remember
I don’t come down to your place and
order you about. A thing of this kind is a
matter of business with me. I can’t interrupt
my men in what they’re doing and send my tug
out to sea every time a couple of lads get sky-larking
in a boat.”</p>

<p>“I’m not asking you any favor,” said Tony,
coldly. “All I do ask you is to hustle. I will
make myself responsible for your bill.”</p>

<p>“Well, now you’re talking!” exclaimed the
ship-owner. “If you’re prepared to hire the
tug, that’s exactly what she’s there for.
Where d’you want her to go?”</p>

<p>Tony was already gently urging Mr. Barker
out of his office toward the tug.</p>

<p>“A few miles beyond the breakwater, to begin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
with,” Tony replied. “If we can’t see
them, we shall have to cruise around till we
pick them up.”</p>

<p>“Thirty dollars is what it will cost you,” Mr.
Barker declared. “And, see here,” he added,
“if I fetch them youngsters in I don’t want to
hear any more o’ that nonsense about salvage
money for bringing in the <i>Grace and Ella</i>.
They’ve been to a lawyer about it, and he’s
pestering me for five hundred dollars and
threatening suit. If my tug gives their sloop
a tow back now, I shall reckon we’re quits,
understand? But if the tug don’t pick ’em up,
it’ll cost you thirty dollars; see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Tony, willing to agree to
almost anything, reasonable or unreasonable,
so long as the <i>Simon P. Barker</i> put off without
further delay.</p>

<p>Mr. Barker instructed Burke, the tug’s skipper,
to consider himself under Tony’s orders.
Tony slipped on board, with Cap’n Crumbie at
his heels, and the moorings were cast off.</p>

<p>“Glad you’re coming along, Cap’n,” said
Tony. “Another pair of eyes may be useful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“By gravy!” the watchman exclaimed. “I’d
ha’ been <em>rowing</em> out soon, if I couldn’t ha’
found any other way o’ getting there!”</p>

<p>Rain had begun to fall by the time the tug
got beyond the breakwater. Burke steered in
the direction of Knife Rock buoy, where by now
even the tug felt the choppiness of the sea.
Nothing could be seen of the sloop, however.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ve run for shelter to some place
down the coast,” Tony suggested.</p>

<p>“That’s likely what they would do, if they
couldn’t make Greenport,” Cap’n Crumbie
agreed, little dreaming that at that moment the
<i>Sea-Lark</i> was helpless and drifting aimlessly,
almost half a dozen miles away to the south.</p>

<p>The tug turned westward, and for several
miles the shore was scanned closely from a
distance, without success. With a heavy
heart Tony at last gave Burke word to return
to the harbor. It was always possible,
he reflected, that word had been received from
some point along the coast that the sloop had
gone ashore there, or been picked up by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
schooner. Further search in the tug, at any
rate, was useless.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll turn up all right,” said Cap’n
Crumbie, as the tug puffed her way fussily back
to her own moorings. He was, however, by no
means certain that he would ever see the lads
again.</p>

<p>Jack’s father, having by now heard what had
happened, was on the wharf awaiting the return
of the tug. Mr. Holden shook his head gravely
as Tony and Cap’n Crumbie stepped ashore.</p>

<p>“It looks bad, very bad, to me,” he said in a
helpless fashion, addressing Tony. “They
must have been blown right out to sea.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, at any rate, Sam,” replied the
boat-builder. “All I know is that those two
boys understand how to manage their sloop,
and they’ve both got plain horse-sense. It’s
no use trying to guess what’s happened to them,
but you can be sure that they did their best.
I’ll believe they’ve been drowned when we find
the <i>Sea-Lark</i> smashed up somewhere on the
rocks, and not until then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>The news quickly spread through the town
that the sloop was missing, and the fact was
duly chronicled that evening in the “Greenport
Gazette.” The reporter who had written the
account had few enough facts to go upon, for
there were none except the bare statement that
the <i>Sea-Lark</i> had put off on a fishing-trip and
failed to return. But that did not deter the
reporter from writing half a column, in which
he told the story of how the <i>Sea-Lark</i> had come
into Jack’s possession, how the boy had started
the ferry and actually made money with it, and
how sincere was the wish expressed by everybody
that Jack Holden and George Santo would soon
be back plying to and fro on their regular
“trade” in the harbor. A photograph of Jack
and also one of his mate appeared on the front
page, together with a snap-shot of the sloop
which some one had taken in the summer as she
lay at the hotel landing on the Point. Altogether,
the boys occupied the post of honor in
the “Greenport Gazette” that evening, even
though it was a somewhat dismal honor. To
fill up his half-column the reporter had written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
glowingly of the courtesy and intelligence of
the ferryman and his assistant, and he also
printed a curiously inaccurate interview with
Cap’n Crumbie on the subject; inaccurate because
Cap’n Crumbie, far too worried by the
lads’ disappearance to bother about being interviewed,
had merely glared at the man with a
note-book and consigned him to oblivion.</p>

<p>One or two of the more venturesome Greenport
skippers, including Bob Sennet, who never
stayed in harbor on account of bad weather if it
was humanly possible to get to the fishing-grounds,
put off to sea, keeping a sharp lookout
for any sign of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>. Captain Jordan,
of the <i>Grace and Ella</i>, even went a dozen or
more miles out of his way in the hope of being
able to rescue the boys, but though the lads actually
saw the sails of the schooner in the distance,
and had high hope of being rescued until
the <i>Grace and Ella</i> went about and disappeared,
the sloop was not seen by any of the fishermen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile even Tony was becoming terribly
depressed. He had at first resolutely declined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
to admit even to himself the possibility that his
son had been lost at sea, but as the day wore on
without word he began to have grave doubts.</p>

<p>The first intelligence Mr. Farnham received
that anything was wrong was when he picked up
the paper that evening and his eyes alighted on
the picture of the sloop.</p>

<p>“By Jove! Rodney, the <i>Sea-Lark’s</i> been
blown out to sea!” he said.</p>

<p>Rodney, who, not having seen anything of
the sloop all day, had imagined it had stopped
running on account of the storm, threw down
the book he was reading and hastened to his
father’s side. Together they read the printed
account of the affair. A few minutes later they
were speeding toward the town, in an automobile.
Cap’n Crumbie, Tony, and Mr. Holden
were standing disconsolately at the end of the
wharf as the car approached.</p>

<p>“Any news of the boys yet?” Mr. Farnham
asked.</p>

<p>The watchman shook his head.</p>

<p>“Has the tug been off searching for them?”</p>

<p>“I went off in her myself,” said Tony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Farnham looked from Tony to Mr.
Holden, and read in their faces the suspense
they were enduring.</p>

<p>“Let’s go off in the tug again, Dad,” Rodney
urged.</p>

<p>“It can be hired, I suppose?” Mr. Farnham
asked.</p>

<p>“Sure!” replied Cap’n Crumbie. “Barker’d
be tickled to death.”</p>

<p>“Then please go and tell him to hold it at
my disposal until darkness sets in. We’ll be
on board in a little while. Mr. Santo, I want
you to let me help you out in any way I can.
I owe it to my boy’s friends, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Mr. Farnham,” replied
Tony. “But there isn’t much we can do, except,
as you say, go off in the tug again.”</p>

<p>“If the boys couldn’t make Greenport, isn’t
it likely that they’d turn and run somewhere
down the coast?”</p>

<p>“They might, of course. But if they’d done
that we ought to have got word by now. They
ought to have run into Penley, by rights. I’ve
telephoned down there twice, and if anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
should be heard of the sloop there I’ll get word
over the wire immediately.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the next place south of
Penley? There isn’t any port for miles, is
there?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere that the <i>Sea-Lark</i> could put in,
until you come to Bristow, and they wouldn’t
have to go as far as that for shelter.”</p>

<p>“Bristow, eh? That’s about forty miles off.
Too far, isn’t it? Anyway, I’ll telegraph to
the authorities there and at the other places up
and down the coast, so that if any news is heard
we shall be advised.”</p>

<p>Mr. Farnham drove off to attend to this
matter, and immediately on his return the
<i>Simon P. Barker</i> put off to sea once more, Tony
joining Rodney and his father on board. The
tug traveled south almost as far as Penley, and
then, bearing off to the east, zigzagged her
course northward again. Two incoming schooners
were sighted, and Mr. Farnham ordered
Burke to head these off, but in neither case had
the men on the vessel seen anything of the sloop.</p>

<p>“It’s been blowing hard all day,” said one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
weather-beaten skipper in reply to their inquiry.
“An’ if the sloop ain’t been picked up,
an’ it ain’t run into Penley, it’s long odds she’s
been swamped afore now.”</p>

<p>Not until darkness made it difficult to pursue
their search further did those on the tug return
to Greenport, by which time a crowd of anxious
watchers had assembled on the wharf, hoping
against hope that the <i>Simon P. Barker</i> might
bring in the eagerly anticipated news. Neither
Tony nor Mr. Holden slept a wink that night,
for there was always a chance that some vessel
might come towing the <i>Sea-Lark</i> back to port.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<small>CASTAWAYS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">As the wild swirl of water rushed over
Jack, he clung desperately to the handle
of the sloop’s pump. The vessel staggered
under her load, but righted herself bravely.</p>

<p>“Are you there?” the boy spluttered, as soon
as he could breathe once more. It was too dark
to see anything.</p>

<p>“I—I think so,” came back the mate’s voice.
“I didn’t expect to be, though. We don’t
want much more of that stuff!”</p>

<p>The hours dragged along with leaden heels.
Twice again during the night the sloop almost
foundered beneath a terrible blow, but each
time managed to right herself. It seemed to
the distressed lads almost a week of darkness
must have passed before a faint blur of light
appeared in the eastern sky. When dawn began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
to approach Jack had arrived at that state
of physical exhaustion when further effort was
almost intolerable, but the sight of returning
daylight, with the possibilities it brought of being
sighted, filled him anew with life. Then, a
little later, his eyes opened wide with blank surprise.</p>

<p>“Why—why, where <em>are</em> we?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The boys stared into the half-gloom away to
the west. The roar of surf was distinct above
the rushing wind, and as the light increased it
was possible for the lads to make out a line of
broken water less than half a mile away.</p>

<p>“That isn’t the mainland,” George declared
presently. “It’s only a little bit of a place.
It surely can’t be Lobster Island! That’s
forty miles or more away from Greenport.”</p>

<p>“Well, how far do you think we’ve drifted
in the last twenty hours or so?” asked the other.
“I haven’t the least notion where this place is,
but I shouldn’t be surprised if we had gone as
far as Lobster Island. It’s a mercy we didn’t
bump up against it during the night. We’d
have been broken to splinters in that surf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“I guess it <em>is</em> Lobster Island,” said George.
“There isn’t any other place it could be. Does
anybody live on it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” replied the captain.
“But even so, I’m going to dump this packet
on the shore.”</p>

<p>“You can’t, Jack, without wrecking her.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, and maybe not. Anyway, it’s
about the only chance I see sticking up at present.
Wait till we drift more to leeward of the
island; then I’m going to make it or bust.”</p>

<p>This sudden appearance of land was the most
welcome sight Jack could have imagined, but
there remained a good deal of deep water between
them and it; and he was by no means
certain that, in the sloop’s badly crippled condition,
she could be urged under the lee shore.
Meanwhile, as the <i>Sea-Lark</i> drifted, the boy
made ready to hoist the throat of the mainsail,
and when the sloop was slowly going past he
hauled up part of the jib.</p>

<p>The sloop shipped a heavy sea during this
operation, and when the canvas bellied she
was almost awash. But, on reaching the comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
smooth water under the lee of the
little island she became more tractable and by
dint of delicate handling the boy was able to
run her ashore on a sheltered, sandy beach.</p>

<p>The moment the keel grounded the two lads,
dripping wet though they were—worn out with
the hardest and longest spell of toil they had
ever known, and hungry as hunters—looked at
each other and laughed.</p>

<p>“Gee! but that was what I call a narrow
squeak!” commented George. “If you’d told
me an hour ago that we should be safely ashore
by now, I should have thought you’d gone
crazy.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t look much like it!”</p>

<p>“Have you cut yourself?” the mate asked,
seeing something dark drop from his chum’s
hand.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” replied Jack, dipping his
hand over the side in the water. “Just a bit
of a blister that burst. Let’s look at your
hands. Mine <em>hurt</em>, I don’t mind admitting,
now.”</p>

<p>George displayed the palms of his hands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
which were in no better condition than those of
his friend.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack sprang from his seat and,
opening the door of the companionway, dived
into the cabin. A moment later he emerged with
a dry package of crackers and a bottle of water.</p>

<p>“You think I’ve had my mind fixed on saving
the sloop, all the night, don’t you?” he
asked, proffering the package to the mate, and
stuffing a cracker into his own mouth. “But
you’re wrong. I kept remembering those
crackers, but we’d both have been drowned as
sure as eggs are eggs if we’d opened that door
and shipped a sea. This stuff has been in a
locker for almost a week, and I’d forgotten
about it.”</p>

<p>“If ever you see me turn up my nose at a
cracker after this,” said George, munching
away, “I give you full permission to kick me
from one end of Greenport to another.”</p>

<p>“We’re not in Greenport yet,” replied Jack.
“Oh, my back’s nearly broken! I don’t think
I could have gone on pumping for another hour
if my life had depended on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>Though their position was dismal enough,
stranded as they were on a barren beach, with
their boat half full of water, the lads were now
strangely happy. The strain of their recent
unnerving experience had been greater than
they realized, and now it was over, the sheer
joy of being alive, and of knowing that death
was not likely to overtake them any minute, was
more than enough to compensate for the fact
that they were still far from being out of the
wood. The sloop was resting firmly enough on
the sand, the receding tide leaving her high and
dry. There remained a great deal of water to
be pumped out of her bilge, but that could stay
where it was for the present. No sign of any
human habitation was visible on the island, but
after resting a few minutes longer the boys
went ashore and explored. They found nothing
much to reward them. The island was
little more than a barren rock, with sparse,
coarse grass growing in places, and also a few
low, straggling bushes. It was less than a thousand
feet long, and only about two hundred feet
across at its widest point. Possibly no human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
foot had stepped ashore there for years. Still,
it offered a secure haven, and on that account
the boys were thankful enough. By eating very
sparingly of their slender supply of crackers
they would at least be able to keep alive for the
present.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember the geography of this
part of the coast awfully well,” said Jack, after
they had made a cursory examination of the
place, “but if this is Lobster Island it can’t be
so far off the mainland. The wind certainly
isn’t quite so strong now. I believe the worst
of the gale is over. I’m going to climb up to
the top of that rock and see if I can spot the
coast.”</p>

<p>The rock in question was not easy to scale,
as it offered no secure foothold, but its summit
was a full twenty feet above the level of the
ocean, and before long the captain of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
was perched precariously on the top.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” he cried, shouting down to his
chum, and pointing away to the north-west.
“<a href="#i_fp244">We’re all right, George. I can see the coast
plainly.</a> And there are two ships in sight—schooners,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
I think. That must be Bristow harbor
over there.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp244">
  <img src="images/i_fp244.jpg" alt="" title="">
  <figcaption class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_244">“We’re all right, George. I can see the coast plainly”</a></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In his excitement he descended from his lofty
perch a little too rapidly. Some distance from
the bottom he slipped and came perilously near
to breaking a bone or two as he rolled heavily
to the spot where George stood. He barked
his shins, and bruised one of his elbows, but
was otherwise unhurt, and after rubbing the
sore places for a few moments almost forgot
about them, in view of the important discovery
he had just made.</p>

<p>“If I can get that eye-bolt fixed in the top of
the mast again,” he said, “we’ll be away from
here within the next few hours.”</p>

<p>“There’s a biggish sea running,” George
cautioned, his eyes roving the tumbling surface.</p>

<p>“It isn’t so bad,” replied the skipper.
“Why, hang it! the wind isn’t half as strong
as it was during the night. In another six hours
or so we shall be able to slip across to Bristow
in no time. You don’t want another night of it,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said George. “I’m just crazy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
about sailing in lovely weather like this. And
the pump is the best part of it, too, isn’t it?
It seems years since I used a pump. Guess I
must have forgotten how to work the thing by
now. If I have forgotten, Jack, I hope you’ll
do any little bit of pumping that might be necessary,”
he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>They had walked back to the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, and
Jack was now standing on her deck, surveying
the damage aloft. He soon realized that to replace
the eye-bolt as it had been was a task beyond
him, but, equipping himself with a few
yards of spare manila rope, he climbed the mast
and set about making temporary repairs. It
had to be a clumsy job at best, but elegance was
of less importance than strength; and before
long he slipped down to the deck, convinced that
the gear would hold.</p>

<p>“The tide will float us again in about another
eight hours,” he declared. “If it’s safe to
make a start by then, we shall have two or three
hours’ daylight to make the run across.”</p>

<p>Toward noon, when the ebb tide had ceased,
and the water was coming in the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
the sloop once more, Jack fished the entire commissariat
supply out of the locker again. It
consisted of exactly five crackers and about
half a pint of luke-warm water at the bottom
of the bottle. The wind had by now dropped
considerably, and there was every prospect of
the lads being able to start on the journey to
Bristow as soon as the <i>Sea-Lark</i> floated.</p>

<p>“Two crackers and a piece of one for you,”
said the captain, dividing them out equally.
“After we’ve eaten this we’ve got to starve
to death or eat sand. Gee! it’s funny how
small a cracker is when you’ve only got
two and a half of them for dinner! If we’d
only thought to lash down that bluefish of
yours!”</p>

<p>George, having eaten his share of the lunch,
yawned. It was more than thirty hours since
he had been asleep.</p>

<p>“It’ll be hours before the sloop’s afloat
again,” he said. “I’m going to turn in and
have a snooze.”</p>

<p>He went into the cabin, and stretching in his
bunk just as he was, fell asleep instantly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Jack sat on the deck, with his back against the
deck-house. He did not remember ever having
been so sleepy and tired. Presently his head
nodded. He raised it with a jerk and then lowered
his chin to his chest once more, while
leaden weights seemed to be dragging his eyelids
down. Just a short nap, he reflected lazily,
would make him feel much fresher. A moment
later he, too, was sound asleep, and when he
awoke a puzzled expression swept over his face.
The water was lapping the side of the sloop.
It must have been that which awoke him. He
had been asleep for hours.</p>

<p>“Come on, George!” he shouted, leaping to
his feet. “We’ll be afloat soon.”</p>

<p>Rubbing his eyes, the mate emerged from the
cabin.</p>

<p>“Why, the wind’s gone right down,” he said.
“That’s fine!”</p>

<p>The sloop, which had been canting over on her
side while ashore, now lay almost on an even
keel. Jack, armed with the boat-hook, and
George with a pole which had been picked up
from the beach in anticipation of this moment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
leaned over the side when the <i>Sea-Lark</i> began
to rock slightly, and without much difficulty
they got her afloat once more. Up went the
mainsail and jib, and away the sloop ran, in the
direction of the shore which Jack had observed
from the top of the rock. In half an hour they
raised land, and not long after that their craft
was nuzzling one of the pile wharves in Bristow
harbor.</p>

<p>“I’ve got just a dollar and fifteen cents,”
said Jack, turning out his pockets. “How
much have you?”</p>

<p>“A dime.”</p>

<p>“We’ll manage all right. First of all we
ought to telephone to Greenport. You’d better
speak to your mother.”</p>

<p>They found a telephone booth near the harbor,
and presently with Jack standing by his side,
George was talking over the wire.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said. “Is that you, Mother?...
We’re at Bristow.... No, we haven’t
got drowned yet.... Yes, we’re all right.
You might tell Mr. Holden.... I’m jolly hungry,
that’s all.... Well, it <em>was</em> a bit rough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
but you needn’t have worried.... No, everything’s
all right, really.... We’re going to
sleep on the boat here to-night, and if the
weather holds good we’ll sail back in the morning....
Yes, thanks, a dollar and a quarter
between us, and we sha’n’t need any more....
In the <em>paper</em>! Our <em>pictures</em>! Oh, <em>crickey</em>!...
All right, Mother. See you in the morning.
G’by.</p>

<p>“Oh, splash!” he exclaimed, hanging up the
receiver. “That’s done it! Jack, we’re dead
and drowned and given up for lost, and in the
‘Greenport Gazette’ as corpses, and half the
town’s almost in mourning for us already.”</p>

<p>“Two eggs,” Jack was saying, already hurrying
his chum away by the arm; “no, three
eggs, and bacon. Lots of bacon. And toast
and butter. And coffee, and—”</p>

<p>“Stop it! you’re making my mouth water,”
protested George. “Here’s a place to get
eats.”</p>

<p>Two of the hungriest boys who had ever sat
down in the restaurant were soon giving their
orders and appealing to the waitress to hurry;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
and it took every cent of their available cash to
settle the bill.</p>

<p>After supper they strolled around the little
town for an hour or two, and then returned to
the sloop for a good night’s rest.</p>

<p>“We ought to get some one to fix that gear
for us properly before we start off,” said Jack,
when they had turned in. “It’s all right as it
is if we don’t strike any more bad weather, but
we don’t want another time like the last.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find somebody to do it,” replied
George, sleepily, from his bunk; and a few
moments later the two young adventurers were
lost in slumber.</p>

<p>The next thing Jack knew, he was sitting bolt
upright in bed. Footsteps on the deck had
awakened him.</p>

<p>“George!” he said.</p>

<p>“Eh? Eh? What’s wrong?” asked the
mate, in the darkness.</p>

<p>Already Jack was out of his bunk.</p>

<p>“There’s somebody prowling about,” replied
the skipper. “Listen! He’s in the cockpit
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>The cabin door opened, and Jack threw himself
into a defensive attitude.</p>

<p>A light flared up in the doorway as a match
was struck, and both boys burst into laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, you two!” said the familiar voice of
Tony Santo.</p>

<p>“Dad!” George exclaimed. “How did you
get here?”</p>

<p>“By train, of course,” replied Tony. “I just
thought I’d run down and see that you were
all right.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good of you,” said George.
“But I told Mother there was nothing wrong.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Nothing at all wrong!” replied
Tony, sarcastically. “What happened?”</p>

<p>“Some of the gear gave way and we couldn’t
use our sails,” Jack explained.</p>

<p>“Well, my boys,” said Tony, “I’m glad it’s
no worse. You certainly did throw a scare into
us all, but it wasn’t your fault. Go back to bed
now. There’s a hotel near here, and I’ll find
a bed there. I’ll take you ashore for breakfast,
and as soon as we get her overhauled we’ll be
off for home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>Next morning Tony strengthened the temporary
repairs which Jack had made, and, with the
breeze still favorable, the <i>Sea-Lark</i> headed for
Greenport while most of the good folk of
Bristow were still in bed. The summer gale
had vanished as quickly as it had come, and the
sloop had an easy passage back.</p>

<small>JACK LOSES COMMAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jack and his chum, on returning to Greenport,
found themselves overwhelmed with
congratulations. They were stopped on the
street and plied with questions, and the reporter
of the “Greenport Gazette” who had, two days
before, firmly believed he was writing the boys’
obituary notices, wrung their hands warmly in
the hope of extracting a good “story.” But
neither the captain nor the mate of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
cared for publicity of this sort.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to print anything more
about us in your paper,” said Jack. “Everybody
knows we got back all right, and there’s
nothing else to it.”</p>

<p>More than that he refused to say to the journalist,
but to Cap’n Crumbie he opened his
heart, and the watchman nodded understandingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
as the boy recounted their adventures.
The reporter, knowing there were more ways of
killing a dog than by drowning it, awaited a
favorable opportunity of tackling Cap’n Crumbie,
and that worthy, without the slightest hesitation,
told the reporter all he wanted to know.
It was, therefore, with something of a shock
that the boys found two columns of the local
paper filled with a thrilling account of their
narrow escape. Cap’n Crumbie, who at all
times was inclined to make a little go a long
way when he was telling a story, had polished
up the high lights and introduced a few bright
ideas of his own; and the reporter, who was
none too particular about facts when it came to
turning out exciting “copy,” had let himself
go. The combined result was a truly harrowing
yarn, which made Jack and his friend roar with
laughter, but which also had the effect of swelling
the number of ferry patrons.</p>

<p>Mr. Farnham, who was a business man to his
finger-tips, stood on the hotel landing with his
wife, watching the <i>Sea-Lark</i> discharging an unusually
large load, and he laughed softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>“Sweet are the uses of advertisement!” he
misquoted with a glance at his wife.</p>

<p>“You mean their adversity has proved an
advertisement,” replied Mrs. Farnham. “Yes,
but I should be sorry if they had another advertisement
of the same kind.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” replied the man of business, “but
give Jack due credit. Lots of chaps would have
taken a day or two off to rest, after going
through all that. His hands were so sore at
first that he could hardly hold the wheel. But
instead of lying back and listening to congratulations,
he got on the job while the rush lasted.”</p>

<p>“He certainly has worked hard this summer.”</p>

<p>“He has,” replied Mr. Farnham, thoughtfully,
“and fellows with as much grit as that
aren’t any too plenty. He ought to go a good
long way in this world. But it won’t be as a
ferryman.”</p>

<p>“It won’t?”</p>

<p>“No”; and Mr. Farnham smiled. “I have
a notion that by the time he gets through High
School he’ll be the sort of chap I shall find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
very useful in my office in New York. But
there’s time enough to think about that.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he said to Jack, stepping down
on to the landing as soon as the last of the passengers
had gone, “I have just got a new dinghy
in place of the one I’ve been using as a tender
to the power-boat. I have no use for the old
dinghy now, so if you’d like to hitch it up behind
the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, you can have it as a tender.”</p>

<p>“Why—why,” began Jack, who knew the
dinghy well enough, and would have liked nothing
better than to own her, but felt that Mr.
Farnham had given him quite enough as it was,
“that would be splendid, only—”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” put in Mr. Farnham,
quickly discerning what was in the lad’s mind.
“I’m not going to make a gift of her to you,
exactly. Let’s put the thing on a proper business
footing, eh?”</p>

<p>Jack smiled. “I’d be glad to,” he said;
“But how?”</p>

<p>“You can take her on condition that whenever
I want to use your ferry during the rest of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
vacation this year, I’m allowed to travel without
paying my fare.”</p>

<p>“But you hardly ever come across,” protested
Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, well, I’ll have to make a few special
journeys to work off the price of the dinghy.
Not another word, now. She’s yours. Rod
will hand her over to you to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much,” Jack called after
Mr. Farnham, who had already turned and was
walking away toward his bungalow.</p>

<p>The proprietor of Holden’s Ferry had but
little time for gossip with his friend the watchman
for several days after his return from
Bristow, but early one morning, while Jack was
preparing the sloop for the day’s work, Cap’n
Crumbie descended from the wharf and sat on
the deck-house watching the lad use the swab.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I forgot to tell you,” said
the watchman. “I’ve got a notion that p’r’aps
we’ve been misjudging those two fellers Hegan
and Martin.”</p>

<p>“Misjudging them?”</p>

<p>“Well, I dunno,” replied the Cap’n.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
“P’r’aps it was only me that did the misjudging,
but I surely did think it was either one or
the other o’ them that tried to brain you with
a bar o’ steel that night.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Jack, curiously.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tain’t reasonable to think so now.
If they’d wanted to do you an injury they
wouldn’t have acted like they did when we all
thought you was getting drownded out there.”</p>

<p>Jack put down the swab.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I watched ’em, watched ’em close, too, when
they heard you’d been blown out to sea,” said
Cap’n Crumbie. “An’ if I ever seed a case
of genooine sorrow in a feller’s face, it was
then.”</p>

<p>“Really!” said Jack, a little puzzled. He
still had a painfully vivid memory of having
been held down to the floor of the cabin by the
throat and almost choked to death. “You can’t
always go much by looks, though.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t only their looks,” said the Cap’n,
shaking his head solemnly. “It was Hegan’s
idea to start a subscription to pay Barker for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
the hire of his old tug to go and save you. And
Martin offered to chip in, too. They meant it,
all right. In another minute or two we’d ha’
been handing that shark Barker the thirty dollars
he asked for before he’d send the tug out.
But just then Tony came along and paid Barker
out of his own pocket.”</p>

<p>“How funny!” said Jack, with a perplexed
frown. “I’m glad you told me. Next time
they come along I must thank them for it.
They were both down on the wharf yesterday,
but I was pretty busy and they didn’t speak.”</p>

<p>“It just shows you,” observed the watchman,
“how you can be mistaken in folks.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” said Jack, a trifle doubtfully.
Then, “Hello, here they come,” he added.</p>

<p>Hegan and Martin strolled to the edge of the
wharf and looked down on the deck of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Jack. “Cap’n
Crumbie has been telling me about your being
kind enough to start a subscription for the tug
when we were blown out to sea. It was awfully
kind of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>“Subscription?” said Hegan. “Oh, yes, I’d
forgotten. That’s nothing. Forget it! You
can’t stand by and see a friend drown, can
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad it didn’t cost you anything, after
all,” said Jack, lightly. “I don’t mind admitting
we should have been mighty glad to see that
tug, and I’m much obliged to you, all the
same.”</p>

<p>“Say, to-morrow’s Sunday. You don’t run
the ferry Sundays, do you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I was just sayin’ to my friend Martin that
p’r’aps we might persuade you to take us for a
sail. We’re both going back to New York to-morrow
night, and I’d like one good run in the
sloop afore I go. What d’you say?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll be glad to,” said the boy, graciously,
feeling that was the least he could do to
repay them for their generous offer of assistance.
“As early as you like. What about
seven o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” replied Hegan. “We’ll be here.”</p>

<p>As George had promised to visit some friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
with his mother next day, Jack arranged with
Rod to accompany him on the trip in the sloop,
promising to pick him up at the hotel landing as
they sailed.</p>

<p>The men kept their appointment punctually
enough. As a matter of fact, they arrived at
the wharf immediately after Jack and George
left the vessel to go home for breakfast; and,
finding the cabin door locked, they asked Cap’n
Crumbie where they could get the key.</p>

<p>“I guess Jack must have it,” replied the
Cap’n; and he remained there, chatting with
them, until the skipper of the <i>Sea-Lark</i> returned.</p>

<p>Sailing across to the landing, they found Rod
awaiting them, and then the sloop’s bow was
turned toward the sea.</p>

<p>“Now, which way do you want to go?” asked
Jack. “The water is dead calm.”</p>

<p>“How about a run down the coast as far as
Penley?” Martin suggested, glancing sideways
at Hegan.</p>

<p>“It’s all the same to me,” replied Hegan,
airily. “So long as I’m afloat with a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
cigar in my mouth, it don’t make any odds
whether we go north, south, east, or west.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jack.</p>

<p>Soon after they got clear of the harbor and
round the end of the breakwater, however,
Hegan, for some unaccountable reason, changed
his mind.</p>

<p>“Let’s run up the coast, as far as Indian
Head,” he said.</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t care where you were
so long as you were afloat,” replied Jack, laughing.
“We mightn’t be able to get back if this
bit of a breeze dropped, because of the tide.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” said Hegan, with rough good
humor. “Let’s take a chance. I’d like to see
the coast around that way, and this wind ain’t
goin’ to drop.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you really want to,” agreed Jack.
“But don’t blame me if you miss your train
through not getting back on time.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Hegan. “I want
to see Indian Head from the ocean. It’s years
since I was off there. How far is it to Baymouth
from the Head?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>The question was put with such curious intentness
that Jack glanced at the man before
replying.</p>

<p>“Thinking of swimming it?” he asked.
“About a couple of miles as the crab walks.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was about that,” replied
Hegan; and then he strolled forward to where
Martin was leaning against the mast. The two
men talked for some time in low voices, watching
the coast-line as the sloop slid slowly past,
but neither Jack nor Rodney took much notice
of them. Presently, however, Hegan turned
round and shouted aft to the captain.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you keep her a bit farther out?”
he asked casually. “We don’t want to hug the
shore all the way up.”</p>

<p>Jack waved a hand in reply, and gave a slight
turn to the wheel, in response to which the <i>Sea-Lark</i>
headed farther east, and before long a
considerable distance separated the sloop from
the shore.</p>

<p>“I guess we had better not go much farther,”
he called out then. “It looks kind of
hazy over there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>“Why, we can’t be so far off Indian Head
now, are we?” Martin queried. “Both of us
wanted to have a look at it.”</p>

<p>“There it is,” replied Jack, pointing off on
the port bow to a blur on the coast which was
rendered vague by the slight haze.</p>

<p>“All right. You don’t mind going up as far
as that, do you?”</p>

<p>Jack hesitated a moment. The wind was so
light now that it would barely be sufficient to
carry them back over the tide, and Greenport
harbor was fully seven or eight miles off.</p>

<p>“This is no power-boat, you know,” he said,
endeavoring to meet the wishes of the men in
good part. “And I don’t like that haze, either.
It wouldn’t surprise me a bit if there was a
regular fog soon. I think we’ll turn back.”</p>

<p>Hegan walked aft with his companion at his
heels.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” he said in a tone which
astounded the skipper. “Keep her going just
as she is till you get orders from me.”</p>

<p>“Orders!” Jack repeated. “If you talk
like that I’ll dump you both out on the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
beach and leave you to get back as well as you
can.”</p>

<p>“No you won’t,” said Hegan with an ugly
expression, drawing a small but wicked-looking
revolver from his coat pocket and pointing it
at Jack.</p>

<p>“<a href="#i_fp266">Put that thing down and stop your nonsense!</a>”
said Jack, furious at such a liberty
being taken. Rodney, taken aback for a moment
by the suddenness of the men’s change of
front, recovered his self-possession and quietly
reached down to the mast rail for one of the
belaying-pins.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp266">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“<em>Drop that!</em>”</p>

<p>The words came from Martin like the crack
of a whip as he swung around, and Rodney saw
that he, too, was armed.</p>

<p>“Is this a joke?” Jack demanded, white to
the lips. He was more than half inclined to let
go the wheel and with one quick step forward
push Hegan over the rail into the sea. But
there was something about the man’s manner
that showed he meant to fire if he were not
obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, just our little joke!” Hegan replied.
“All the same, you won’t see any fun in it if
you don’t do as you’re told.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any fun in for you either,
soon,” replied Jack, glancing over his shoulder.
“Look at this fog-bank drifting up. We’re going
to be in a nice fix.”</p>

<p>“Just what I want,” replied Hegan. “Now,
take it calm, and p’r’aps you won’t get hurt. I
don’t know that it wouldn’t be best to thump
you both on the top of the head and drop you
overboard. Nice time you’ve given us! ain’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Given <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that!” snapped Hegan.
“The least said the soonest mended. Here,
give me that wheel, and get for’ard. Keep
’em covered, Martin. This feller looks as
though he was going to try to give us a bit o’
trouble. What d’you say? Shall we make
’em swim for it? A two-mile swim on a day
like this is good for any one.” He laughed
evilly.</p>

<p>“You stick to the program, Hegan,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Martin. “No killin’; that’s what we agreed
on.”</p>

<p>The edge of the fog-bank was already enveloping
the sloop, and the coast-line was now
hidden from view.</p>

<p>“But a nice little swim—” Hegan began.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” Martin snarled, losing his temper.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Hegan. “You always
was a chicken-livered cuss, huh? Now, Captain,
oblige me and my friend by steppin’
for’ard up against your pal, so that if necessary
Martin can chip bits off you both with that gun
o’ his.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do anything of the kind,” replied
Jack, pluckily, although he had an uncomfortable
feeling that Hegan’s revolver was pointed
at the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>“Guess you will,” said Hegan, sneeringly,
as he stepped back a few feet. “I’m going to
count three. If you ain’t makin’ yourself
scarce in that vicinity by the time I say ‘three,’
I’ll fire past you. I don’t want to do any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
killin’, mind. I’ll fire to miss you the first
time, but the second shot won’t miss.”</p>

<p>Jack stared stubbornly at the man, who, however,
showed no signs of wavering. And the
shining weapon in his hand was a painfully conclusive
argument.</p>

<p>“One!” said Hegan.</p>

<p>Jack set his lips tightly but continued to hold
on to the wheel.</p>

<p>“Two!”</p>

<p>“Three!”</p>

<p>There was a sharp report, and a bullet
whizzed within a foot of Jack’s head. It would
have been sheer suicide to hold out any longer
against such odds. The boy frowned and
walked forward to where Rod was standing.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you’re going to do that sort of
thing,” he said, “you can have your own way
just now. But you’ll have to smart for it later
on.”</p>

<p>Taking possession of the wheel, Hegan
steered farther into the bewildering fog.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind them, Martin,” he said. “But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
keep your eyes skinned, all the same, or they’ll
slip one over on you.”</p>

<p>Although Jack had found discretion the better
part of valor, he was by no means inclined
to take his medicine lying down.</p>

<p>“You bet we will!” he declared truculently.
“I was an idiot to let you come off with us,
anyway! It was one of you two who tried to
choke me in the cabin a little while back. I felt
pretty certain of it all along. But after what
the watchman told me yesterday I thought I
must have been mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” said Hegan. “My
friend Martin was to blame for that. He always
makes a mess of things if I’m not along
to help him.”</p>

<p>Martin’s revolver went off, and Rod, who had
again stooped quickly to pick up a belaying-pin,
straightened himself with a jerk.</p>

<p>“Aw, <em>would</em> you!” grinned Martin. “Next
time you try any of that stuff you’ll get hit;
see?”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you chaps want?” Jack
asked savagely. “You can’t get away with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
this sloop! I’ll have the fishermen hunting
all along the coast for it.”</p>

<p>The two men exchanged glances, and Hegan
winked at his companion.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t they like to know?” he jeered.</p>

<p>“Keep your mouth shut,” Martin growled
warningly.</p>

<small>CAST ADRIFT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Whatever the intention of the two
men was, their plans were now being
affected by something they had not anticipated.
The fog had blotted out everything except
a comparatively small space of the ocean
around them; and, to complicate matters still
more, the sails of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, after flapping
lazily for a while, now began to hang limply.
The faint breeze had died down entirely, and
the sloop lay motionless.</p>

<p>“This ain’t no good!” Hegan commented at
length, addressing his companion. “Better
set them two adrift in their dinghy.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to do that for?” demanded
the captain, heatedly. So long as he
had both feet on the sloop’s deck he stood at
least some chance of defending his property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t ask questions,” snapped Hegan.
“Hop over the side, there.”</p>

<p>With both Martin and Hegan covering them
with revolvers, the lads had no alternative but
to obey. They were in the dinghy and Martin
still held the painter in his hand ready to cast
it loose, when an idea occurred to Hegan.</p>

<p>“Pass me up those oars,” he ordered.</p>

<p>Jack gave a sudden tug on the painter but did
not succeed in dragging it from Martin’s hand.</p>

<p>“Come down and get them yourself if you’re
so anxious for the things,” Jack retorted.</p>

<p>“You young varmint! Bound to give us as
much trouble as you can, ain’t you?” snarled
Hegan, clambering over the side and nearly
swamping the little dinghy—which was never
made to hold more than two—as he gained possession
of the oars.</p>

<p>“What did you expect me to do?” asked Jack.
“Hand them up to you politely and then kiss
you good-by? I suppose you fellows both
know you’ll go to prison for this as soon as the
police put their hands on you.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got to catch us first,” grunted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
Hegan as, with his foot on the prow of the
dinghy, he pushed it off. It slid a few yards
through the water and then lay still by the side
of the <i>Sea-Lark</i> until a faint puff of wind fluttered
the sails of the sloop and she drifted half
a cable’s length farther away.</p>

<p>“What in the name of goodness do you suppose
those chaps did that for?” Jack exclaimed
presently.</p>

<p>“They’ve got some crazy notion of stealing
the sloop, I guess,” replied Rodney. “It <em>is</em>
crazy, though. To begin with, they can’t get
far. They’ll have to put in at Baymouth or
some other place within a few miles. And
when we land it won’t be half an hour before
all the police along this part of the coast are
looking out for them. They can’t disguise her,
and they won’t have more than a few hours to
sell her.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help thinking the same way that you
do about it,” replied Jack, laughing, for in spite
of the unpleasantness of their position there
was something utterly ludicrous and unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
about it. “But we’re not ashore yet.
Got no oars, remember.”</p>

<p>“How far is the coast from here?”</p>

<p>Jack shrugged.</p>

<p>“A couple of miles, perhaps. I guess it can’t
be much more. I <em>think</em> it lies over there,” he
said, pointing vaguely into the bewildering
mass of fog.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> think it’s over here,” declared Rod,
pointing in nearly the opposite direction.
“The sloop is—” He turned to glance in the
direction of the sloop, but found the mist had
swallowed her up.</p>

<p>“She’s over there,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“No, she’s over there,” Rod contradicted.</p>

<p>“What are you going by? The wind, or the
sun?”</p>

<p>“Guesswork,” owned Rod, realizing that in
a dead calm, surrounded by fog, all points of the
compass looked alike.</p>

<p>“We’re stuck! That’s all there is to it,”
said Jack. “Nothing much can happen to us,
though, as it’s such fine weather, barring the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
fog. And that’s bound to lift soon. We can
paddle ashore with our hands, on a pinch, as
soon as we can see where we are.”</p>

<p>But the fog continued to hang over the surface
like a pall, and the boys waited with what
patience they could muster, because, though by
paddling with their hands they might be able
to send the dinghy through the water at the
rate of a mile an hour or even more, they were
as likely as not to paddle her farther out to sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack straightened up and put his
head on one side, listening.</p>

<p>“What was that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Didn’t hear a thing,” replied Rod.</p>

<p>“I did, though,” declared the captain.
“Listen!”</p>

<p>After a while a faint creaking sound came
over the water.</p>

<p>“Hear it then?” Jack asked.</p>

<p>The other nodded. “What was it?” he
queried, straining his ears afresh.</p>

<p>A smile came slowly to Jack’s face.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s the sloop,” he declared.
“She’s stuck, anyway, the same as we are, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
know. Hegan and his pal will have to stay just
where they are until a breeze happens along.
And there hasn’t been more than a breath of
air since they threw us out.”</p>

<p>“It might be some other boat,” Rod suggested.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon settle that,” said Jack.
“Ahoy, there! Ahoy!”</p>

<p>He knew that call must travel some distance
in such still air, and when no answering hail
was returned his suspicions were confirmed.</p>

<p>“Can’t you picture them, as mad as a couple
of hornets!” Jack chuckled. “They’ve fallen
into their own trap and they can’t get out of
it until a breeze comes.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s no chance of paddling
back alongside and catching them off their
guard?” Rod suggested.</p>

<p>The captain frowned thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” he said. “They’ll be getting
the jumps soon. We’d make a pretty good
target, remember, if they started to take potshots
at us. All the same, I’m game if you are.
It would be better than sitting here and doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
nothing. <em>There</em> she goes again! You heard?
It’s the boom swinging in the swell. Here,
what idiots we are!” he went on, stooping and
lifting the floor boards of the dinghy. “What
could you want better than these for paddles?
Quietly, now! If they hear us coming we shall
have no better chance than when we drifted
away. I expect it will be no good, anyway, but
I can’t sit still doing nothing, much longer.”</p>

<p>Judging as accurately as possible the direction
of the sound that came across the water
occasionally, they began to paddle softly, and
within five minutes Jack held up a warning
hand and pointed ahead, where the shape of
the <i>Sea-Lark</i> loomed dimly.</p>

<p>For another twenty fathoms they urged
the dinghy along, until it was possible to see
the sloop distinctly. Contrary to Jack’s expectation,
there was nobody visible on deck. In
such a dead calm it would have been useless for
Hegan to stand by the wheel, but Jack was
puzzled. The dinghy was now drawing near the
vessel.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they’ve—” Rod began in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
whisper; whereupon Jack silenced him with an
imperative gesture. The sloop looked as
though she had been abandoned, but as there
was no small boat in which the men could leave
her, that was obviously not the explanation.
By signs only did Jack now communicate with
his friend. Like a wraith, the dinghy slid under
the <i>Sea-Lark’s</i> bow. Motioning Rod to keep the
little craft from bumping against the side of the
sloop, Jack placed his hands on the deck and
slowly drew himself up until he was aboard the
<i>Sea-Lark</i> again, on his hands and knees. Still
nobody challenged him. His pulse was beating
a shade faster than usual as he crawled cautiously
down the little alleyway between the
deck-house and the low rail, for there was no
disguising the fact that he was inviting trouble.
There were two armed men, evidently entirely
unscrupulous fellows, to contend with. If they
suddenly saw him creeping along the deck, it
was the most likely thing in the world that one
of them would blaze away with his revolver.</p>

<p>Jack came near to the port-hole let into the
side of the deck-house. By looking through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
there he would be able to see the inside of the
cabin. But unfortunately those inside the
cabin stood an equally good chance of seeing
him, with consequences distinctly unpleasant, if
not painful. He could hear them now. They
were evidently engaged in some dispute, for
Hegan’s raucous voice was raised in protest
more than once, and he heard Martin say:
“Well, hurry up, then.”</p>

<p>There came, also, a peculiar sound as of dull
blows and the straining of woodwork.</p>

<p>A wild hope had come into Jack’s head, but
in order to execute the plan which he hastily
formed it became necessary for him to pass before
the port-hole.</p>

<p>Cautiously he leaned forward until his eyes
fell on the forms of the men inside. They had
their backs turned toward him, and were intent
on some work of destruction. In his hand
Hegan held a short bar of steel, just such an
implement as Jack had found on the cabin floor
after the midnight struggle. With it he was
tearing away one of the boards that formed the
sheathing of the cabin. Several such boards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
had already been ripped off and lay in splinters
on the floor.</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s gone!” Martin exclaimed in
an angry voice.</p>

<p>“And if it’s gone,” retorted Hegan, turning
toward his companion, with the bar of steel
held menacingly in the air, “there’s only one
person who could have taken it.”</p>

<p>“What d’you mean?” demanded Martin.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I say. If you’ve double-crossed
me you won’t get away with it.
You’ll have me to reckon with. I know now
why you didn’t want to come off in the sloop
to-day. I thought at first it was just because
you were naturally scared o’ anything bigger
than a chicken. Now I got you!”</p>

<p>“I tell you I don’t know a thing about it,”
Martin protested in whining tones. “Maybe
it’s there, after all. Smash another board
off.”</p>

<p>Hegan returned to his task, and for a few
minutes there was no sound beyond the rending
of planks from the side of the cabin, and the
creaking of rusted nails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly Hegan gave a cry and put his hand
down behind the sheathing.</p>

<p>“I see it!” he cried exultantly. “Just like
we left it, too! Sort of misjudged you, didn’t
I? Guess you wouldn’t have the pluck to
double-cross a feller like me, though! Here it
is, safe and sound!”</p>

<p>Then he drew from behind the sheathing the
thing for which he had been seeking.</p>

<p>And Jack, watching through the port, saw
the man’s hand grasping the strange object of
his search.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<small>TRAPPED!</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jack had remained motionless, watching
this strange spectacle, but he now crept
noiselessly astern while the men were engaged
with their discovery. Evidently they did not
notice his form pass the port-hole, but the most
critical part of his task lay ahead. If only he
could reach the cockpit unobserved and fasten
Hegan and Martin up in the cabin, the tables
would, indeed, be turned.</p>

<p>The lad peered cautiously round the after
end of the deck-house and his face brightened,
for one of the doors was half closed. That
gave him a chance to approach the companionway
without being seen. His movements, however,
had to be slow, for any sudden jerk on the
part of the sloop would instantly have aroused
the suspicion of the men. He hardly breathed
as he put one foot over the edge of the cockpit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
and upon the broad seat, his eyes glued the
while on the doors, which swung outward.
There was a bare chance that he might bang
both of them to and fasten them before Hegan
and Martin had time to interfere. It would
be the work of an instant only, once he got near
enough to accomplish his object, and the catch
with which the closed doors could be fastened
together was hanging down temptingly.</p>

<p>A fresh dispute had evidently arisen between
the two men, for they were speaking angrily
once more, and while they were so engaged the
boy gently closed the half-open door. Then
with a swift movement he reached across for
the other door and closed it with a bang, snapping
the catch across firmly.</p>

<p>Instantly an outcry arose in the cabin.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” shouted Martin.</p>

<p>“Open that door!” yelled Hegan.</p>

<p>For answer Jack took a key from his pocket,
slipped the padlock through the catch, and
locked it.</p>

<p>“Come on, Rod,” he called, springing back
on deck from the cockpit and taking the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
dinghy’s painter aboard. “We’ve got them!”</p>

<p>“What? How did you do it?” Rod asked,
puzzled. His nerves had been sorely tried by
an anxious wait of fully five minutes during
which time anything might have happened at
any moment.</p>

<p>“I shut the door on them, that’s all. They
were asleep at the switch!”</p>

<p>“Hello, there! Open this door!” the two
men were now shouting together.</p>

<p>“You stop where you are, and be quiet,”
Jack shouted back.</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” Hegan called out. “What’s
the idea of fastening us up? Can’t you take
a joke?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Jack. “Now it’s your
turn.”</p>

<p>“Well, this ain’t funny,” replied Hegan.
“Just you open the door, an’ we’ll call it
quits.”</p>

<p>“Not likely,” said the boy. “I’ll open the
door when we get back to Greenport and there’s
a police officer to talk to you as you come out.
Perhaps you can explain to him what you mean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
by turning me off my boat and smashing my
cabin up.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t let us out I’ll break the door
open and then you’ll have real trouble on your
hands!”</p>

<p>“They’ll have some difficulty in breaking
that door open,” said Rodney. “Meanwhile,
look at that!” He pointed to the canvas which
was again fluttering. “Pretty soon we’ll be
able to sail back.”</p>

<p>“Not till this fog lifts,” replied Jack. “I’ve
got a compass, but it’s in the locker down there.
There she comes,” he added as a puff of wind
swept over the sea. “This’ll soon blow the
fog away.”</p>

<p>The men below had been quiet for a few moments,
evidently holding a council of war.</p>

<p>“Jack,” Hegan called out at last.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want you to open this door and have a
talk.”</p>

<p>“You can talk where you are if you want to.
I’m listening.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I want to get out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>“I have told you I’m not going to let you
out.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t, it’ll be your funeral,” declared
Hegan. “Listen here, we made up our
minds that we weren’t going to hurt any one
if we could help it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not hurting any one,” retorted
Jack, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“We will if we start shooting. We’ve got
plenty of cartridges left and they’ll go clean
through this door. One of you may get killed,
so I’m giving you fair warning.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to take a chance,” replied Jack,
moving from the companionway door, and seeking
safety on deck. “You blaze away if it
amuses you.”</p>

<p>Immediately there came a muffled report from
the interior of the cabin, and a bullet piercing
the woodwork, sang its way over the stern of
the sloop.</p>

<p>“Now, will you let us out?” Hegan demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, very soon,” replied Jack. “We’ll be
in Greenport before long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>Another shot rang out, and Jack, who had
taken hold of the wheel, gave a start as the bullet
narrowly missed him. The breeze was
freshening rapidly, and already he could dimly
make out a portion of the coast-line, which gave
the captain a general idea in which direction to
steer. But to stand there and deliberately present
himself as a target for the two ruffians in
the cabin, had no appeal for him whatever. He
slipped behind the wheel, and crouched down
as low as possible, at the same time motioning
Rodney to go forward, out of range.</p>

<p>“Don’t take any chances, Rod,” he advised.</p>

<p>The <i>Sea-Lark</i> was now leaning over gently
before the breeze, and beginning to cut along
slowly toward the harbor.</p>

<p>“They couldn’t hit a hay-stack in a passage,”
shouted Rodney, derisively, as he
skipped into the bow.</p>

<p>Immediately a shot came flying through the
forward end of the deck-house, and Rodney
ducked behind the mast.</p>

<p>“Have you two had enough of it yet?”
Hegan bawled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>“Keep her going, if it amuses you,” replied
Jack from his vantage-ground. “The more
shots you fire now, the better I like it. All
these holes in the side of the cabin will make the
evidence against you lots worse.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an idiot,” said Hegan. “You’re
only making it worse for yourselves when I get
at you. I’m going to shoot the lock off if you
don’t unfasten it, but I’ll keep a shot for you.”</p>

<p>Jack knew well enough that this would prove
no idle threat if the men did succeed in blowing
the fastening off the door, and they would be
able to do that easily enough if their ammunition
held out. Still, it was something to be
forewarned.</p>

<p>“Rod!” he called out, beckoning with his finger.</p>

<p>Rodney quickly came aft.</p>

<p>“I want you to take this wheel,” Jack said.
“Keep down as much as you can and they’ll
never hit you.”</p>

<p>“What are <em>you</em> going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get ready with the boat-hook,
in case they manage to break the door open,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
replied the other, grimly, as another shot came
through the side of the cabin and buried itself
in the woodwork of the cockpit. “See, they’ve
started to fire around the lock. It won’t hold
forever under that sort of treatment. If only
we could keep them there another half-hour we
should be round the end of the breakwater, but
I’m afraid they’ll smash their way out before
that.”</p>

<p>“You stick to the steering,” said Rodney.
“I’ll tackle them with the boat-hook.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t do as I tell you,” said the captain,
firmly, “I’ll swing her up into the wind,
and we’ll lose time. Ouch!” he added, as another
bullet whizzed past.</p>

<p>Reluctantly Rodney obeyed. Jack seized the
boat-hook, and stood on the deck at the edge of
the cockpit, ready for the struggle which he
now felt was inevitable. It would still have
been possible for him and his chum to get away
in the dinghy, but the sloop was heading for
harbor, and there was a tempting sporting
chance for Jack to win out. Moreover, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
by no means sure that if he and Rodney did get
away in the dinghy Hegan and his confederate
would allow them to escape scot-free, for the
men could overtake the dinghy rapidly, now
that a fresh breeze was filling the sails.</p>

<p>Two more shots rang out, and the door of the
companionway became badly splintered.</p>

<p>“Are you going to let us out?” demanded
Hegan’s voice, in menacing tones.</p>

<p>Jack cautiously moved out of the way before
replying.</p>

<p>“No, and if you put your head out you’ll
get the boat-hook on top of it!” he shouted.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, and then a heavy
thumping began on the inside of the door. The
men were using the table as a battering-ram.
Jack moved nearer the cockpit again, and stood
watching with misgiving the effects of the resounding
blows. Suddenly Rodney gave a
startled cry, at the same time pointing ahead.</p>

<p>Round the end of the breakwater, with all
sails set, a fishing-schooner was coming.</p>

<p>“Starboard a bit, Rod, and cut her off,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Jack. “Hegan, you’d better stop that now,”
he added, raising his voice. “There’s a
schooner coming.”</p>

<p>This information was apparently far from
good news to the two captives. The battering
ceased momentarily, and three shots were fired
in rapid succession at the lock, which almost
broke away. When the shots ceased Jack
leaped down into the cockpit, with the boat-hook
raised above his head, ready to defend himself
as the men broke out of the cabin, but the instant
he landed in front of the door another bullet tore
its way through the woodwork, and he felt a
sharp, stinging pain in his leg, just above the
knee. With an involuntary cry he clapped his
hand to the injured place.</p>

<p>“Come and take the wheel,” cried Rodney.
“You’ve been hit, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Stop where you are. It’s nothing,” replied
Jack, gritting his teeth nevertheless as his
leg began to throb. The boat-hook was but an
indifferent weapon against men with loaded revolvers,
but it seemed to Jack that the enemy
would have only a few shots left, if any. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
sloop and the schooner, moreover, were now approaching
each other rapidly. The fishing-vessel
had gone about, and her present course was
taking her almost straight toward the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.
Another minute or so would bring the vessels
within speaking distance. Rod was already
signaling as best he could.</p>

<p>Below deck, the prisoners were again assailing
the door, and blows fell with telling effect
against the weakening lock. With poised boat-hook,
Jack watched and waited. Suddenly,
with a crash, the doors flew open and Hegan,
his face contorted with rage, leaped up the
steps.</p>

<p>“Drop that boat-hook!” he commanded
savagely, his revolver pointing at Jack’s
breast. Behind him, Martin peered across his
shoulder, his features set in a malicious grin.</p>

<p>Jack, backing away, pointed to the schooner.
<a href="#i_fp292">“You’re too late, Hegan,” he said.</a></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp292">
  <img src="images/i_fp292.jpg" alt="" title="">
  <figcaption class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_293">“You’re too late, Hegan,” he said</a></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Hegan shot a quick glance over the water
and then, with a snarl of rage, hurled his revolver
straight at the boy’s face. Jack ducked,
but not in time to escape a glancing blow on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
top of the head, which sent him reeling back.
Seizing his advantage, Hegan leaped forward,
but Rodney with a final hail to the schooner,
now close at hand, left the wheel and hurled
himself on top of Hegan. His weight bore the
man down, and Jack, recovering, steadied himself
to meet a new onslaught which came from
Martin. Clutching the barrel of his empty
weapon, Martin aimed a blow, but Jack was before
him and brought the boat-hook crashing
down on the man’s arm. The revolver dropped
to the floor of the cockpit just as a deep voice
came from the deck of the fishing-craft.</p>

<p>“Hello, there! Hello, there! What’s all
this about?” It was Bob Sennet who spoke,
and with flopping sails the <i>Ellen E. Hanks</i> nosed
alongside the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, and the skipper, his
huge hands bunched formidably, leaped to the
deck of the sloop.</p>

<p>“You’re just in time, Captain,” growled
Hegan. “These young ruffians were nearly
killing the pair of us.”</p>

<p>Bob Sennet’s eyes fell on the dark mark on
Jack’s trousers, which were already badly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
stained from his wound. From there his gaze
traveled to the revolver at Martin’s feet. Jack,
now that the worst of the excitement was over,
was feeling curiously weak. He sank down on
the cockpit seat, and hoped fervently that he
was not going to do anything so foolish as faint.
It was as though a red-hot iron was being bored
into his leg, and he felt absurdly dizzy.</p>

<p>“Give me that gun,” the fisherman demanded
of Martin, who picked up the weapon and
handed it over.</p>

<p>Hegan made a movement in the direction of
the dinghy, whereupon Bob Sennet strode forward,
took him by the collar, and flung him
roughly into the bottom of the cockpit.</p>

<p>“So these two boys were nearly killing the
pair of you, were they!” the burly fisherman
said. “I’ve seen one of ’em at the wheel for
the last five minutes. The other has a boat-hook
in his hand, and a bullet in his leg, if I’m
not mistaken. That yarn don’t go with me, and
it won’t go with the police. Have they another
gun, Jack?” he demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>“They had, but Hegan threw it at me when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
it was empty, and it must have gone overboard.”</p>

<p>“What’s their game?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know, Captain Sennet,” replied
Jack, “but I’d be very much obliged if
you’d help us back to Greenport.”</p>

<p>“You bet I will! Now, then, you two,” he
went on addressing Hegan and Martin, “get
onto the schooner. Nearly killing the pair of
you, were they? A fine yarn! Hey! What in
<em>thunder</em>!” Captain Sennet’s head went forward
and his eyes widened in astonishment as
he saw the broken, bullet-torn doors of the
companion way. “Has somebody gone <em>crazy</em>!”
he added.</p>

<p>Jack was by now in a state of semi-collapse,
and the fisherman, picking him up, laid him
gently on the deck of the sloop.</p>

<p>“They turned us adrift in the dory,” Rodney
explained, “but there wasn’t any wind, so we
were able to paddle alongside again and Jack
slipped aboard and fastened them up in the
cabin.”</p>

<p>“Well, I dunno,” said Captain Sennet, “but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
by rights you two ought both to be dead now,
’cording to what’s been going on. Joe,” he
called out, raising his voice and addressing the
mate on board the schooner, “tie those two
beauties up good and tight, or they might get
away from you yet. Now pass a line aboard
here, and beat it back to the harbor.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the schooner was heading
for Greenport, with the <i>Sea-Lark</i> in tow, and
Captain Sennet was standing, amazed, amid
the scene of wreckage in this little cabin of the
sloop.</p>

<p>“Say!” He pushed his cap back and rubbed
his head perplexedly, addressing Rodney.
“For the love of Mike, will you just tell me what
them fellers have been up to in here? Half the
sheathing is torn down! They must ha’ gone
clean crazy. Why—” Suddenly he stopped
and his jaw dropped, as, turning round and
glancing on to one of the bunks, he saw something
which took away his breath.</p>

<p>“What in <em>thunder</em>!” he began; and then, with
a broad smile he leaned over the bunk and fingered
his discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“Money!” exclaimed Rodney.</p>

<p>“Some one must ha’ been robbing a bank!”
laughed Captain Sennet. “Fives—tens—twenties!
Ho, ho! I reckon that accounts for
some o’ the milk in this particular cocoanut.
Let’s put it in that thing,” he went on, picking
up a canvas bag and stowing the pile of paper
currency and coins into it. “Guess I’ll take
charge o’ this till we find whose it is,” he added,
dropping the bag into his pocket.</p>

<p>Back on deck, he gave his attention to Jack.</p>

<p>“We’ll have you in a doctor’s hands soon,”
he said. “Much pain?”</p>

<p>“Not too much,” said Jack, with a grimace.
“My head hurts most. I don’t think the bullet
wound amounts to much.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look at it,” said the fisherman,
rolling up the boy’s trouser leg and displaying
a clean wound in the flesh about four inches
above the knee. The bullet had entered the
flesh at the front and passed out again at the
back without touching the bone. Rodney produced
a handkerchief, and the skipper bathed
the injury with sea-water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind if it smarts a bit,” he said.
“You want it clean, anyway. There’s no great
harm done there, though it’s a mystery to me
how you both got off as lightly as you did,
with all that lead flying around.</p>

<p>“Had you got any money hidden in that
cabin o’ yours, Jack?” he asked, after binding
up the wound with the handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Money?” the lad asked. “There was about
eighty cents in my coat pocket. That’s all I
know of.”</p>

<p>“I mean a pile o’ money.”</p>

<p>“A pile?” asked the captain of the <i>Sea-Lark</i>.
“I know there wasn’t any other money in the
place. I <em>ought</em> to know.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what you <em>didn’t</em> know,” replied
the fisherman. “I think I begin to understand
it, though. You’ve seen that mess
those fellers have made o’ the inside o’ the
cabin?”</p>

<p>“I saw that through the port-hole.”</p>

<p>Captain Sennet drew the canvas bag from his
pocket.</p>

<p>“This must ha’ been what they were after,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
he said. He held it out and Jack examined it
curiously. On its side was printed “Barker
and Holden.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said the boy, opening
the bag, and looking in puzzlement at the bills
and coin within.</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about it, do you,
Rod?”</p>

<p>“Never saw it before in my life,” answered
Rodney, blankly. “Whose is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Jack. “I don’t understand
it at all!”</p>

<p>“No, nor me, neither,” said the fisherman.
“Leastwise, I ain’t got the proper hang of it,
but I’ve got a notion, just the same. You say
these two men set you adrift in the dinghy?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“And then as soon as your backs were turned
they started to strip off all the sheathing o’
the cabin?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. And I saw Hegan put his hand
behind one of the boards and lift this bag out.”</p>

<p>“Then,” declared Captain Sennet, logically,
“if they went after this they must ha’ knowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
it was there, and if they did <em>they must ha’ been
the ones who put it there</em>! Who else could ha’
knowed where it was, besides them as put it
there?”</p>

<p>Jack sat up suddenly, with a most astounding
idea in his head. “I’m going to count it,”
he announced.</p>

<p>“Count it, eh?” said Bob Sennet. “All
right. Might as well know what we’ve got.”</p>

<p>Eagerly Jack emptied the contents of the
sack upon the seat and, with the others watching
curiously, counted bills and coins. At last,
“Twelve hundred and forty dollars!” he cried
excitedly. “Just what I suspected! Don’t
you see, Captain?”</p>

<p>Bob Sennet shook his head. “Can’t say I
do, Jack. Guess you’d better tell me.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, this is the money my father was
robbed of three years ago!”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Rodney. “But how did
it get here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but—”</p>

<p>“I do,” interrupted the captain of the <i>Ellen
E. Hanks</i>. “Those sculpins put it here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>“But—but when? The <i>Sea-Lark’s</i> been
lying over on the dunes for two years or
more!”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” asked Bob Sennet.
“Wasn’t nothing to keep them from going over
there and dropping the bag behind the cabin
sheathing, was there? If they wanted to hide
it that was a pretty good place, wasn’t it?
And—why, look here, Jack, maybe these fellows
is the ones that stole the money from your
father!”</p>

<p>“I wonder!” said Jack. “Anyway, it’s all
a puzzle to me. Why should the men have hidden
it on the <i>Sea-Lark</i>? And if they did hide
it there, why didn’t they take it away again
during all the time the sloop lay on the dunes?”</p>

<p>Bob Sennet shook his head in perplexity.
“Now’s the time to find out, if it ever is to
be found out,” he said as the schooner’s sails
dropped and she sidled toward her usual berth,
much to the surprise of those who had seen her
put to sea a short time before.</p>

<p>“What’s amiss?” Cap’n Crumbie shouted
from Garnett and Sayer’s wharf, seeing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
sloop towing astern and Bob Sennet aboard of
her.</p>

<p>“Telephone to the police station,” replied
Captain Sennet, “and tell the chief he’s wanted
down here, quick. I want to get off to sea as
soon as I can.”</p>

<p>The watchman delivered the message, and
shortly afterward the chief stepped on board
the <i>Ellen E. Hanks</i>, where the crew were standing
expectantly in a group. Jack, limping
painfully, had joined them, determined to see
the thing through now. Rodney and Cap’n
Crumbie had also gone on to the schooner as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the chief as he stepped
off the wharf.</p>

<p>“There’s two men trussed up in the cabin,
who are going to prison for several years, if
I’m any judge,” replied the skipper. “Theft,
and usin’ firearms, and goodness knows what
else. We happened along just when they were
in the thick of it. Afore you go down and take
a squint at ’em I want to tell you all I know.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” replied the chief, alert and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
ready to grasp the essential points of the case.
Bob Sennet briefly told of all he had seen, and
showed the bag of money to the police official,
who raised his eyebrows in astonishment.</p>

<p>“And you say there’s just twelve hundred
and forty dollars there! That must be the
stolen bag, all right,” he said. “This explains
a lot that we didn’t rightly understand before.”
The latter remark was addressed to
Jack. “But the robbery took place a long time
ago, and we may have difficulty in fastening the
guilt on these men, even if they are the actual
culprits, unless one of them can be made to confess.
However, I may be able to work it. Men
of that kind have no scruples when it comes to
saving their own skins. Bring them up on deck
one at a time.”</p>

<p>A minute later the man known as Martin was
ushered into the presence of the chief. The
latter looked at him curiously for a brief space,
and then smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Whitey,” he said. “Going by the
name of Martin now, are you, eh? Haven’t
seen you for quite a while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>“My name ain’t White,” the man blustered.</p>

<p>“It used to be. It was, anyway, when you
and your pal were arrested at Baymouth for
burglary, and you were both sent to prison for
three years. You only got out a while back,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, what about it?” demanded White, in
a surly manner, seeing that further denial was
useless.</p>

<p>“Only this, that I’m afraid you’ll have to
go back again, and for a longer spell this time.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked White. “We’ve only
been defending ourselves against these boys.”</p>

<p>“That yarn won’t go,” replied the chief.
“The captain of this schooner saw too much
for you to get out of it. But I’m not talking
about to-day’s affair. It’s something else
you’ll stand trial for.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t done anything,” growled the
man.</p>

<p>“Haven’t, eh? What about knocking down
Sam Holden three years ago and getting away
with twelve hundred dollars? Forgotten all
about that, have you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>“I wasn’t in on that. You can’t prove—”</p>

<p>“How’d you come by the money, then?”
snapped the chief.</p>

<p>White darted a glance at the stern faces encircling
him and moistened his lips.</p>

<p>“It was Hegan hit him,” he blurted.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I saw him,” White floundered.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the chief, ironically.
“That is just what I wanted to be sure of.
What happened after the pair of you got away
with the money?”</p>

<p>Again White looked round appealingly to
those near, and hesitated.</p>

<p>“You’d better come across,” urged the
chief. “We’ve got you, remember, and you
can’t squirm out of it. You must have hidden
the money in the cabin of the sloop at once, because
it was only the next day that you and
Hegan were arrested at Baymouth, and you’ve
been in the prison since then, until very recently.
It may make it easier for you if you
tell me the truth now.”</p>

<p>White shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>“It wasn’t me hit Holden on the head, remember,”
he said. “I was against that sort
of thing all along. Hegan found out that this
man Holden sometimes took a lot of money
down to his house instead o’ leaving it at the
office in the safe. We waited for Holden in
the street, and Hegan laid him out. We’d
seen this sloop lying off the wharves and so
when we had the money we slid down there and
got aboard her. We were afraid to wait
around at the station for a train. We didn’t
want the sloop, mind you. All we wanted was
to get away, and we thought we might make
some place up the coast around Baymouth, run
the sloop ashore, and foot it for the railroad.
Hegan had the bag of money when we went
aboard, and the first thing he did was to look
for some place where it wouldn’t be found if
the cops got us. One of the boards was so as
we could pry it loose at the top and he shoved
the bag behind it. It was pretty rough when
we got outside and I was for turning back, but
Hegan wouldn’t agree to that, and we headed
up the shore. Things got pretty bad and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
made sure we’d both be drowned, as I didn’t
know much about sailing and Hegan wasn’t
a whole lot better at it. The gale got us off
Indian Head and we were nearly swamped.
Our bit of sail went and next thing we knew
we were drifting up the river. After a while
she ran on a sand-bank and the waves came
right across her deck. We tried to get hold
of the bag, but it had slipped down where we
couldn’t reach it. We were fairly scared by
that time and so we left it and swam ashore,
somehow, meaning to go back next morning.
But we didn’t, because that same night
the cops nabbed us both for the old burglary.
I got three years and so did Hegan. Soon as
I was out I beat it back here to get the money,
but young Jack Holden was running the sloop
and I couldn’t find a chance. Then Hegan
showed up and we went after it together.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the chief. “That accounts for
the yarns about folks prowling around on the
sloop at night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that,” declared
the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>“Now, White, it’s no use your denying it.
There wasn’t anybody but you and Hegan who
had reason to attack those lads in that cabin.”</p>

<p>White shook his head, however, and would
not further commit himself.</p>

<p>“When did you get that tear in your trousers?”
the chief asked, pointing to a very amateurish
patch.</p>

<p>“A long time ago,” White said.</p>

<p>“Mended it yourself, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Guess I did. Why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only I guess I know why you
didn’t take it to a tailor. Wanted to keep it
quiet, didn’t you? A little bit of the cloth
was missing, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said White.</p>

<p>“But I do. Jack Holden showed it to me.
He found it on a nail where you’d left it one
night. By itself it wasn’t much of a clue,
but it fits in nicely now. Here, Wilson,” the
chief added, turning to a policeman who had
accompanied him, “take this man to the station
and lock him up. Now for the other fellow.”</p>

<p>Hegan was still full of fight when brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
on deck, but he quieted down as soon as he saw
the game was hopelessly up.</p>

<p>“Well, Hegan,” the chief began, “you soon
got into trouble again after being released,
didn’t you? White told us all about it.
You’re both going to be the guests of the
Government for some little time. There’s one
thing I want you to tell me, though. Was it
you or your pal who used to sneak down on to
the sloop nights while she was lying at the
wharf?”</p>

<p>“If it had been me,” replied Hegan, scornfully,
“you bet we wouldn’t ha’ been in this
fix now. I’d have got the money and been off.
Whitey’s afraid of his own shadow.”</p>

<small>THE CANVAS BAG</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Half an hour after Hegan had followed
his confederate from the schooner to
jail, Jack was lying in bed, joking with the doctor
who was bandaging his wound, the pain in
which was much easier now that it had been
properly dressed.</p>

<p>“How about the Ferry?” the lad asked.
“Mayn’t I get up to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the man of medicine firmly.
“You’ll have to stay put for at least a couple
of days. Fortunately it’s only a slight wound,
but you must give it a chance to heal. You’ll
be all right in a week, anyway. Now, promise
me you won’t try to stand on that game leg till
Tuesday morning.”</p>

<p>“All right, if you insist,” replied Jack.
“Hello, Dad, is that you?” he added, raising
his voice as the street door opened. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
not seen his father since returning from the
astonishing trip in the <i>Sea-Lark</i>, for Mr.
Holden had gone off on his usual Sunday-morning
walk.</p>

<p>Pantingly Mr. Holden hurried up the stairs.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with you, boy?” he asked as
he entered the room. “I’ve just heard outside
that you’ve been shot.”</p>

<p>“It’s only a scratch,” replied Jack. “The
doctor says I’ll probably be able to get up to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Tuesday,” the kindly old doctor corrected,
trying to look severe and making a complete
failure of it. “If you get out of bed to-morrow
I’ll chloroform you and amputate both legs.
Don’t worry about him, Mr. Holden. He’ll be
all right. Healthy flesh like his soon heals, but
I want to give it a fair start. Good morning,
Jack. Tuesday, mind! Good morning, Mr.
Holden.”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden looked white as he sat on the
edge of his son’s bed, for he was not yet over
the shock of the news.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it, Jack,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>Jack smiled.</p>

<p>“I will in a minute, Dad,” he replied. “But
I have a little surprise for you first. You remember
the night when you were robbed of that
money?” Jack thrust his hand beneath his
pillow, and felt a canvas bag that lay concealed
there.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Jack,” Mr. Holden answered.</p>

<p>“Have you ever had any hope of getting it
back?”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden shook his head slowly. “Not
after the first few days,” he replied gloomily.</p>

<p>“You’d be tickled to death, then, if it turned
up now?”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk foolishly, lad. Such things don’t
happen.”</p>

<p>“But if it did, Dad? What would you do?”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden would have preferred not to discuss
the painful matter, but to humor his son,
he rested his chin on his hands and thought for
a while.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at length, a twinkle coming
into his eyes. “I’d ask you to let me put your
salvage money with it, and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>“Salvage money? I’m afraid Mr. Barker
doesn’t mean to pay a cent of that,” the boy
declared. “He ought to, according to the law,
but the law doesn’t seem to be everything.”</p>

<p>The twinkle was still in Mr. Holden’s eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re wrong, boy,” he said.
“The law does amount to a great deal. I met
Mr. Merrill while I was out walking this morning,
and he’s just told me something you’ll be
glad to hear.”</p>

<p>“About the—the salvage?”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden nodded.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” Jack asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“That Mr. Barker has decided to pay the
whole amount rather than go to court,” announced
the boy’s father, triumphantly.</p>

<p>Jack stared, for that was the last thing he had
expected. Then he began to laugh, for he still
had his own good news to tell.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mr. Holden went on, “he’s going to
hand the check over next week. Yesterday was
the last day Mr. Merrill gave him before taking
the matter to court, and as Mr. Barker knew
he would have to pay in the long run, he went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
round to the lawyer’s house last night and tried
to make a dicker. But Mr. Merrill held out
until he got a promise that the whole amount
would be paid.”</p>

<p>“Really?” exclaimed Jack. “That’s fine!
We’ll be as rich as—as anything, sha’n’t we?”</p>

<p>“Well, you will, son.”</p>

<p>“And so will you! I mean—” Jack pulled
himself up and made a new start: “You were
saying that if you got back the money that was
stolen you’d put the salvage money with it,
weren’t you? And then what?”</p>

<p>“Why, in that case— But why talk about it,
Jack? That sort of miracle isn’t likely to
happen.”</p>

<p>“But—but suppose it did,” Jack insisted.
“Suppose it had!”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden shook his head, smiling sadly.
“Then I think I’d go back into business again,
son,” he answered.</p>

<p>“How?” the boy asked eagerly, rising on his
elbow.</p>

<p>“I’d go into partnership with Garnett and
Sayer. Mr. Garnett told me only a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
weeks ago that he’d be willing to let me buy
a small interest for fifteen hundred dollars.
But he might as well have said fifteen thousand.”</p>

<p>Jack’s fingers tightened on the canvas bag
underneath the pillow, and he drew it slowly
forth.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen this before?” he asked,
holding out the long missing article in question.</p>

<p>“Why, <em>Jack</em>!” Mr. Holden looked from the
bag to his son’s merry face. “Where did that
come from?”</p>

<p>“Open it, Dad!”</p>

<p>With trembling fingers Mr. Holden obeyed,
and his gaze fell on the contents.</p>

<p>“There’s none missing,” said the boy, unable
to keep up the game any longer. “And it
was on my sloop all the time!”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t understand!” said Mr. Holden.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t!” laughed Jack. “It
kept us all guessing for a long while.” And
then he explained everything, while his father,
the precious bag of money on his knees, listened.</p>

<p>“When those two men go to prison for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
theft—and they are going—” he concluded,
“your name will be cleared completely, Dad,
won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” replied Mr. Holden. “Even Barker
won’t be able to insinuate things then.”</p>

<p>There came a rap at the street door, and
George and Rodney came hurrying up the
stairs. “Well, they haven’t spoilt your beauty,
anyway,” exclaimed George. “I was afraid
you’d got your nose shot off or something.
How’s your leg?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much wrong,” replied Jack.
“I’ll be on board again by Tuesday, but I’ve
got to stop in bed till then.”</p>

<p>“You’d better let George and me run the
ferry for a day or two,” said Rodney. “You
see if we don’t do a roaring business. The
story’s got all over the place by now, and half
the town has been down to look at the bullet
holes on the sloop. Everybody will want to run
across in the <i>Sea-Lark</i> to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Go to it,” replied Jack. “That’s fine!”</p>

<p>Mr. Holden, bearing his miraculously restored
money, slipped from the room and the visitors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
perched themselves on Jack’s bed, and George,
frankly disgusted at having missed the adventure,
insisted on hearing a full and detailed account
of it. Jack acted as chief historian and
Rodney saw to it that he left nothing out, and
when they had ended George shook his head
regretfully.</p>

<p>“Just my luck to get left out of it,” he said.
“But I suppose that if I’d been along those
thugs wouldn’t have tried anything.”</p>

<p>“You hate yourself, don’t you?” laughed
Rodney.</p>

<p>“Well, with three of us instead of two—”</p>

<p>“George is right,” said Jack. “They
wouldn’t have faced such odds, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t they?” demanded Rodney.
“They went out to get that money back, and
they’d have managed it somehow. Maybe
they’d have acted nastier than they did. By
the way, Dad and the rest of them said I was
to tell you how sorry they are, you know, and—and
all that. And Dad told me this morning
that if you want a place in his office when you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
get through school you can have it. Wish
you’d take it, because I’ll have a chance of
seeing you now and then.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty kind of him,” answered
Jack, gratefully, “and I guess I’d love to try
it. I wish you’d thank him for me, Rod.
I’ll see him myself as soon as the doctor lets
me out, but I’d like him to know that I appreciate
his—his offer.”</p>

<p>“All right, Captain. I’ve got to beat it now.
I’ll be in again to-morrow to see how you’re
getting along. Don’t worry about the ferry.
George and I will keep it moving, all right!”</p>

<p>When the boys had gone Mr. Holden came
back, and Jack, who had been doing some thinking
in the meanwhile, greeted him with a question.
“Dad,” he asked, “how much is twelve
and five?”</p>

<p>“Why, seventeen! Or it was when I went to
school.” Mr. Holden was in high spirits and
laughed gayly at his little joke. “Why, son?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was thinking, Dad. If you take that
five hundred and put it with the twelve—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know that I ought to, Jack. Maybe
it would be safer for you to put your money in
the bank—”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Of course you’re going to take
it! Gee! look at all the money you’ve spent
on me!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d pay it back gradually, son, and—”</p>

<p>“Don’t want it! Besides, as I figure it, you
won’t need all of it, anyway, will you?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, only three hundred, or maybe
three-fifty.”</p>

<p>“Great! That’ll leave a hundred and fifty,
then. And I know a bully way to spend that!”</p>

<p>“To spend it?” asked his father, dubiously.
“Don’t you think that maybe you’d better—er,—save
it, son?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean spend exactly: I meant invest.
You see, Dad, the ferry has done pretty
well this summer and I guess it’ll do even
better next year, because there are more folks
coming here every season. Rod’s father has
offered me a job when I’m through school and
I think I’d like to accept it, but he probably
won’t want me until fall, and so I might as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
keep on with the ferry. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, yes. You’ve made a good deal
of money with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And even if I wasn’t here all summer
George could run it for me and I’d still make
on it. But what the <i>Sea-Lark</i> needs, Dad, is
an engine—just a two-cylinder motor that’ll
kick her back and forth, wind or no wind.
And I know where I can get a perfectly good
second-hand one for a hundred and twenty-five,
maybe less. So that’s where the rest of
that salvage money is going, Dad. I’m going
to invest it in Holden’s Ferry.”</p>
